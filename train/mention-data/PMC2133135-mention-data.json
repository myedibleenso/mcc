The Ras-related GTPase, R-Ras, modulates integrin affinity, but little is known of  the signaling pathways and biological functions downstream of R-Ras. Here we show that stable expression  of activated R-Ras or the closely related TC21 (R-Ras  2) induced integrin-mediated migration and invasion of  breast epithelial cells through collagen and disrupted  differentiation into tubule structures, whereas dominant negative R-Ras had opposite effects. These results  imply novel roles for R-Ras and TC21 in promoting a  transformed phenotype and in the basal migration and  polarization of these cells. Importantly, R-Ras induced  an increase in cellular adhesion and migration on collagen but not fibronectin, suggesting that R-Ras signals  to specific integrins. This was further supported by experiments in which R-Ras enhanced the migration of  cells expressing integrin chimeras containing the alpha2,  but not the alpha5, cytoplasmic domain. In addition, a  transdominant inhibition previously noted only between integrin beta cytoplasmic domains was observed for  the alpha2 cytoplasmic domain; alpha2beta1-mediated migration  was inhibited by the expression of excess alpha2 but not alpha5  cytoplasmic domain-containing chimeras, suggesting  the existence of limiting factors that bind the integrin alpha subunit. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found  that R-Ras induced migration on collagen through a  combination of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C, but not MAPK, which is distinct from the  other Ras family members, Rac, Cdc42, and N- and K-Ras. Thus, R-Ras communicates with specific integrin alpha cytoplasmic domains through a unique combination of signaling pathways to promote cell migration  and invasion.\n\n\n\nIntegrins are a family of alpha/beta heterodimers that mediate cellular interactions with components of the extracellular matrix, resulting in regulation of cell differentiation, growth control, and cellular migration and  invasion. Integrins participate in a number of signaling  events in cells. Signaling events induced by the extracellular matrix through integrins, termed outside-in signaling,  include activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK) 1  pathway, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as  focal adhesion kinase, phosphoinositide turnover, Ca 2+  influx, Na + / H +  exchange, and alterations in gene expression  and cellular growth (for review see XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Signaling events also impinge upon integrin function by regulating the ability of integrins to bind their  ligands, a process termed inside-out signaling or integrin  activation. Regulation of integrin-ligand interactions by  inside-out signaling helps determine the nature of cellular responses to the extracellular matrix, influencing decisions such as whether a cell will remain stationary or migrate (XREF_BIBR). Integrin cytoplasmic domains,  though relatively short, are necessary for their participation in both outside-in and inside-out signaling events. Despite much recent progress, the current understanding of  integrin-related signaling events is still in its infancy.\n\nOne of the most intriguing, but poorly understood, aspects of integrin function is how specific integrin subunits  link to specific signaling pathways to create the appropriate cellular response. A handful of studies have begun to  address this question (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR). For example, differences in integrin effects have been correlated to the ability of certain integrin  subunits (alpha1beta1, alpha5beta1, and alphavbeta3) but not others (alpha2beta1,  alpha3beta1, and alpha6beta1) to recruit Shc and activate the MAPK  pathway (XREF_BIBR). Moreover, integrin subunit  specificity has been shown for association of integrins with  transmembrane-4 superfamily proteins and activation of  phosphatidylinositol 4-(PI4) kinase (XREF_BIBR).  Although these studies begin to address specificity of outside-in signaling pathways, less well-studied is the specificity of inside-out signaling pathways.\n\nRecently, it has become evident that both outside-in and  inside-out integrin signaling pathways can involve small  GTPases of the Ras superfamily (for review see XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Integrins signaling collaborates  with growth factor-induced signaling through the Ras-MAPK pathway (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR), and can directly activate the MAPK  pathway by both Ras-dependent and -independent means  (P. XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Signaling  through integrins also activates signaling pathways involving members of the Rho family of GTPases (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). The  bidirectional nature of these signaling events is demonstrated by the finding that integrin clustering into focal  complexes can be regulated by Rho family members, Rho,  Rac, and Cdc42 (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR) or by Ras (XREF_BIBR). Additionally, activation of Rac and Cdc42 stimulates integrin-mediated migration and invasion across collagen matrices  (XREF_BIBR). Ras family members have direct effects on integrin function, since H-Ras suppresses integrin  activation (XREF_BIBR), whereas R-Ras activates  integrins, resulting in increased cell adhesion and matrix  assembly (XREF_BIBR).\n\nR-Ras is a 23-kD GTP-binding molecule ~55% homologous to H-, N-, and K-Ras, with an extra 26 amino acids  at its NH 2  terminus (XREF_BIBR). Despite this homology, the biological function of R-Ras is distinct from  H-Ras (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR). R-Ras binds to many of the same effectors as H-, N-, or K-Ras, including Raf and Ral-GDS  (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR),  but is unable to activate these effectors efficiently (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, R-Ras is  able to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)- Akt/PKB pathway (XREF_BIBR). The transforming  properties of R-Ras remain under investigation, and are  partially dependent on the specific cell in question (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).  TC21 (R-Ras2), the closest relative of R-Ras, is also implicated in cellular transformation of fibroblasts and human  breast carcinomas (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR),  although TC21 shares more functional similarity to H-Ras  than R-Ras (XREF_BIBR). Other than PI3K activation, the signaling pathways and full range of biological effects downstream of R-Ras function are not known.\n\nWe previously showed that stable expression of constitutively active Cdc42 or Rac alters the response of breast  epithelial cells to a collagen matrix by disrupting polarization and promoting a migratory invasive phenotype  (XREF_BIBR). The effect of Cdc42 and Rac is mediated by PI3K (XREF_BIBR). Additionally, the ability  of these cells to polarize or migrate in collagenous matrices is related to alpha2beta1 integrin expression levels (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Since R-Ras has been shown to  have direct effects on both integrin function and PI3K activity, we determined in this study whether R-Ras can alter  breast cell response to the extracellular matrix. We find  that R-Ras activation disrupts the polarized differentiation of breast epithelial cells in collagen matrices and stimulates migration and invasion through collagen, suggesting  new roles for R-Ras. Additionally, we find that R-Ras specifically stimulates migration and adhesion to collagen but  not fibronectin. Using integrin chimeras, we demonstrate  cross-talk between R-Ras and the alpha2, but not the alpha5, integrin cytoplasmic tail, resulting in enhanced migration of  breast epithelial cells. Surprisingly, R-Ras-induced migration was only partially dependent on PI3K activity,  suggesting that PI3K-independent signaling pathways  also contribute to the effects of R-Ras. We find that one  of these pathways involves protein kinase C (PKC). Migration induced by R-Ras did not involve the MAPK kinase (MEK)/MAPK pathway, which differed from K-Ras- induced migration. Thus, R-Ras affects specific integrin alpha  cytoplasmic domains through multiple distinct combinations of signaling pathways to activate cell migration and  transformation.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nR-Ras or TC21 (R-Ras2) Expression Affects the  Differentiation of Mammary Epithelial Cells in Three-dimensional Collagen Gel Culture.\n\nWell differentiated human breast carcinoma T47D cells  maintain the ability to polarize into tubule and ductlike  structures when cultured in three-dimensional collagen  gels (XREF_BIBR). This differentiation is dependent  on the alpha2beta1 integrin (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). One of the characteristics of T47D differentiation  into tubules is the multicellular nature of the structure,  such that individual cell-cell boundaries become more difficult to distinguish, as can be noted in Fig. XREF_FIG A. Stable expression of activated R-Ras(87L) in T47D cells disrupted  the ability of these cells to differentiate and polarize in collagen gel culture, instead the cells grew as disorganized  clumps and sheets of individual, nonpolarized cells                   . Similar results were obtained with cells stably expressing another activated R-Ras isoform, R-Ras(38V) (not  shown). Thus, activation of R-Ras results in a less differentiated, more transformed phenotype. In contrast, stable  expression of dominant negative R-Ras(43N) enhanced  differentiation; tubule structures developed earlier and  were more extensive                  . This suggests that endogenous R-Ras may play a negative role in regulating the rate  or extent of normal epithelial differentiation. Like R-Ras,  expression of constitutively active TC21(72L) disrupted  differentiation in collagen gels                  , whereas expression of dominant negative TC21(26A) enhanced differentiation in a qualitative manner                  . This suggested  that TC21, like R-Ras, is a negative regulator of breast cell  differentiation. \n\n\n\nR-Ras and TC21 Stimulate Migration and Invasion  Specifically across Collagen.\n\nBreast carcinoma progression is accompanied by the loss  of polarization and differentiation, and the acquisition  of a migratory invasive phenotype. Migration was determined using a Boyden chamber haptotactic assay in which  transwells were coated on the underside with collagen.  Expression of activated R-Ras isoforms, R-Ras(87L) or  R-Ras(38V), significantly enhanced cell migration relative  to control cells                  , indicating that R-Ras activation  promotes a more migratory phenotype. Dominant negative R-Ras(41A) inhibited migration by ~45-50%                   , suggesting a contribution of R-Ras to basal migratory  mechanisms. Activated TC21(72L) also enhanced cell migration, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent than R-Ras                   . Expression of activated isoforms of other Ras  family members, N-Ras(12D) and K-Ras(12V), also enhanced cell migration across collagen, but to a lesser extent than R-Ras                  . \n\nThe migration induced by R-Ras(87L) across collagen-coated filters was dependent on the alpha2beta1 integrin, since it  could be completely inhibited by anti-alpha2beta1 blocking antibodies                  . Similarly, TC21(72L)-induced cell migration was also alpha2beta1 integrin-dependent                  . These results are consistent with the finding that the alpha2beta1 integrin  is a major collagen receptor in breast epithelial cells that  mediates many of their responses to collagenous matrices  (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).\n\nTo examine whether the effect of R-Ras was specific for  collagen, cell migration across fibronectin was determined.  Surprisingly, expression of R-Ras(87L) or R-Ras(38V) did  not enhance and, in fact, partially inhibited migration  across fibronectin by ~40%                  . R-Ras(87L) did not  enhance or inhibit migration of cells across laminin (not  shown). Similar results were obtained for TC21(72L),  which also inhibited migration across fibronectin by 25%,  although this difference was not statistically significant                   . The difference between migration across collagen and fibronectin is not due to dramatically different  levels of migration, since similar numbers of control cells  migrate across each substratum, as shown by a representative experiment in Table XREF_TABLE. In contrast to the results with  R-Ras and TC21, expression of either N-Ras(12D) or  K-Ras(12V) enhanced migration across fibronectin                   . Thus, R-Ras and TC21 differ from N- and K-Ras in the  specificity of substrata on which they enhance cell migration. \n\nTo metastasize, cells must not only migrate but must  also invade through extracellular matrices. Therefore, we  examined the ability of transfected cells to invade through  a 2-mm-thick collagen gel in response to a serum gradient.  Consistent with their more migratory phenotype, cells expressing activated R-Ras(87L) or R-Ras(38V) were significantly more invasive through collagen than control cells                 . Similarly, activated TC21(72L), N-Ras(12D), and  K-Ras(12V) induced cell invasion                . Because basal  invasion levels of T47D cells are already so low, we did not  further investigate the effect of dominant negative R-Ras  or TC21 on invasion. Therefore, we find that expression of  activated R-Ras or TC21 converts cells from a polarized,  differentiated phenotype into a migratory and invasive  phenotype. \n\n\n\nR-Ras Specifically Affects the alpha2 Integrin Cytoplasmic Domain.\n\nNext, we examined the effect of R-Ras on adhesion of  cells to collagen and fibronectin since R-Ras activation  specifically enhanced cell migration across collagen, but  decreased migration across fibronectin. This was of particular interest since it has been shown that expression of activated R-Ras(38V) increases the adhesion of myeloid  cells to fibronectin and vitronectin through activation of  integrin subunits (XREF_BIBR). Similar to these results, we found that expression of activated R-Ras(87L)  enhanced adhesion to collagen by a modest but consistent  amount                  , demonstrating an effect of R-Ras activation on the avidity of cells for collagen. Dominant negative R-Ras(41A) decreased adhesion to collagen                    by a similar amount, demonstrating a contribution of endogenous R-Ras to cell adhesion. The other dominant  negative isoform of R-Ras, R-Ras(43N), did not affect cell  adhesion (not shown). Expression of TC21 isoforms had  no consistent or significant effect on adhesion of cells to  collagen (not shown). In contrast to the effect on cell adhesion to collagen, expression of R-Ras(87L) or R-Ras-  (41A) did not affect cell adhesion to fibronectin                  .  This is in contrast to the results of XREF_BIBR who  found increased adhesion of myeloid cells to fibronectin  substrata. This suggests that there are cell-type specific differences in the effects of R-Ras on different integrin subunits. \n\nTo determine whether changes in cell migration and adhesion could be explained by altered expression of endogenous integrin subunits, integrin alpha subunit expression was  examined by flow cytometry. Cells expressing activated  R-Ras(87L) or dominant negative R-Ras(41A) or R-Ras(43N) showed no change in the expression of integrin subunits alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, or alpha6 (not shown). Additionally, there  were no changes noted in expression of alpha4 (not shown), an  integrin subunit not normally expressed in these cells.  Therefore, R-Ras-induced changes in cell migration and  adhesion are not due to changes in integrin subunit expression.\n\nTo examine if an apparent change in integrin avidity was  reflected in a detectable change in integrin conformation,  we used a conformationally sensitive anti-beta1 integrin antibody, 12G10. The 12G10 epitope is known to be expressed  on integrins that are activated by manganese. We found no  increase in 12G10 binding, as determined by flow cytometry, in cells expressing R-Ras(87L) compared with control  cells (not shown). This result suggests that changes in apparent integrin avidity because of R-Ras activation either  do not correlate to conformational changes, or that R-Ras  changes integrin conformation in a manner not detected  by this antibody.\n\nThe R-Ras-enhanced migration and adhesion of cells to  collagen via alpha2beta1, but not fibronectin via alpha5beta1, suggests  that, in these cells, R-Ras affects specific integrin subunits.  Since the beta subunits are identical, we speculated that  R-Ras specifically signals to the alpha2 cytoplasmic domain.  To test this hypothesis, the effects of R-Ras on a chimeric  integrin containing the alpha2 cytoplasmic domain were compared with its effects on a similar chimera containing the  alpha5 cytoplasmic domain. Chimeric integrins with the extracellular domain of the alpha4 subunit and the cytoplasmic domain of either the alpha2 subunit (X4C2) or the alpha5 subunit  (X4C5) were transfected into control and R-Ras(87L)- expressing cells. Some cells were instead transfected with  the complete alpha4 subunit (X4C4). We selected alpha4 integrin  chimeras since T47D cells normally do not express the alpha4  subunit                                 which allowed us to monitor the expression of the chimeras in our control and  R-Ras-transfected cells. Each of the alpha4 chimeras was expressed at similar levels on the surface of control and  R-Ras-expressing cells                     . Since individual integrin alpha subunits are not expressed on the cell surface, this  indicates that alpha4beta1 heterodimers were formed. Importantly, expression of alpha4 chimeras did not affect the expression of endogenous alpha2                          or alpha5 subunits  (not shown). \n\nThe ligand for the alpha4beta1 integrin is the CS-1 sequence  found in the COOH-terminal 40-kD heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). This 40-kD fragment does not contain the RGD  sequence that is the ligand for the alpha5beta1 integrin in fibronectin. Therefore, to specifically assess the effects of  R-Ras expression on the X4 chimeras, cell migration  across membranes coated with either the CS-1 peptide or  the 40-kD fragment was determined, since untransfected  T47D cells do not migrate across these substrata (not  shown). We found that expression of the X4 chimeras in  T47D cells conferred the ability to migrate on the 40-kD  fragment and the CS-1 peptide                  . Interestingly,  R-Ras(87L) enhanced migration of cells expressing X4C2  and decreased migration of cells expressing X4C5                   . This is consistent with our finding that R-Ras enhances  migration across collagen and decreases migration across  fibronectin                . R-Ras(87L) also enhanced migration  of X4C4-expressing cells, suggesting that R-Ras not only  signals to the alpha2, but also the alpha4 cytoplasmic domains in  breast epithelial cells                  . Cells expressing an alpha4 chimera containing no alpha cytoplasmic domain, X4C0, were unable to migrate across the 40-kD and CS-1 substrata (not  shown), indicating the importance of an intact alpha cytoplasmic domain for cell migration. These results suggest that  R-Ras activation enhances alpha2beta1 integrin function and diminishes alpha5beta1 integrin function, at least with regard to cell  migration. \n\nWe also determined whether cells expressing alpha4 chimeras had altered migration across collagen. Since the alpha4 chimeras do not bind collagen, any effect will be due to pleiotropic effects on endogenous integrin subunits. Expression  of X4C2, but not X4C4 or X4C0, blocked the increase in  migration of cells across collagen that is induced by activated R-Ras(87L)                  , suggesting that there is some  form of competition between the X4C2 subunit and the  endogenous alpha2 subunit. Thus, the effects of R-Ras on endogenous alpha2 subunits can be antagonized specifically by  de novo expression of alpha2 cytoplasmic domains. Such dominant negative effects of integrin cytoplasmic domains  have been noted previously with expression of exogenous  beta cytoplasmic domains (Y.P. XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, this is the first  demonstration of transdominant inhibition by a specific alpha  integrin subunit. This suggests that there may be competition for a limited supply of alpha cytoplasmic domain binding  factors. Conversely, X4C5 expression slightly enhanced the  R-Ras(87L)-induced migration across collagen                  ,  although this enhancement is not statistically significant when  compared to the results obtained with cells expressing  X4C4 or X4C0. These results provide additional evidence  that R-Ras signaling involves specific integrin subunits.\n\n\n\nPI3K and PKC Contribute to R-Ras- and TC21-induced Cell Migration.\n\nWe previously found that migration induced by the small  GTPases, Rac and Cdc42, was dependent on PI3K (XREF_BIBR). Like Rac and Cdc42, R-Ras also has been  shown to activate PI3K (XREF_BIBR). Therefore, we  determined whether pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K,  Wortmannin, and LY294002, could inhibit the migration  induced by R-Ras. Wortmannin (30 nM) and LY294002  (25 muM) significantly inhibited the migration induced by  activated R-Ras(87L) or R-Ras(38V)                  . However,  unlike the total inhibition previously noted with Rac and  Cdc42-expressing cells (XREF_BIBR), the effect of  PI3K inhibition on R-Ras-induced migration was only  partial; migration was inhibited only by ~50%. Wortmannin and LY294002 also only partially inhibited the migration induced by activated TC21(72L)                  . Thus,  PI3K activity contributes to R-Ras-induced cell migration,  but other signaling pathways are probably also involved. \n\nPKC has been implicated in the migration of some cell  types (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR). Pretreatment of cells with 1 muM bisindolylmalemide, an inhibitor of most isoforms of PKC,  significantly inhibited the migration of R-Ras(87L) or  R-Ras(38V)-expressing cells                  . Once again, inhibiting PKC produced only partial inhibition of R-Ras- induced cell migration. Bisindolylmalemide also partially  inhibited the migration of cells expressing TC21(72L) and  K-Ras(12V), albeit to an even lesser extent than the effect  on R-Ras cells (not shown). The concentration of bisindolylmalemide used was adequate, since pretreatment of  cells with this concentration inhibited PKC activity to  background levels in an in vitro PKC kinase assay (data  not shown). Since certain isoforms of PKC (delta, epsilon, and eta)  can be activated downstream of PI3K (XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR), we wished to determine if PKC and  PI3K might be part of the same signaling pathway leading  to cell migration, or separate pathways that both contribute to migration. Treatment of cells with Wortmannin and  bisindolylmalemide had an additive effect and completely  inhibited the increased migration induced by R-Ras expression                  , suggesting that PI3K and PKC each  contribute to R-Ras-induced cell migration through separate pathways.\n\nOther pharmacological inhibitors of signaling pathways  potentially downstream of R-Ras were also tested. The  MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (XREF_BIBR), had no effect on migration induced by activated R-Ras or TC21                   , despite inhibiting MAPK activation 50-60% in  cells expressing R-Ras(38V), R-Ras(87L), or TC21(72L)  (data not shown). In sharp contrast, PD98059 significantly  inhibited K-Ras-induced cell migration                  , demonstrating important differences in the mechanism by which  R-Ras and K-Ras induce migration. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase, also did not inhibit cell migration (not  shown), which is consistent with previous results with Rac  and Cdc42 (XREF_BIBR).\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn this study, we show that activated R-Ras disrupts mammary epithelial polarization in three-dimensional collagen  gels and induces migration and invasion across collagenous matrices. These results implicate a role for R-Ras in  the transformation of mammary epithelial cells, a role that  has not been described previously. We find similar results  for a molecule closely related to R-Ras, TC21, which extends previous results by XREF_BIBR demonstrating  that TC21 can alter breast epithelial morphology. We also  find that R-Ras enhances cell adhesion to collagen, which  is consistent with its previously described role in promoting increased integrin avidity (XREF_BIBR). Importantly, R-Ras enhances cell migration and adhesion specifically on collagen, but not fibronectin. This substratum  specificity reflects a difference in the effect of R-Ras on  the alpha2 versus the alpha5 integrin cytoplasmic domains. Such  specificity has not been described previously for the effects of R-Ras on integrin subunits, and could have important implications for inside-out integrin signaling events  that lead to migration and invasion on collagenous matrices. Finally, migration induced by R-Ras is partially  blocked by inhibitors of PI3K and PKC, but not by a MEK  inhibitor, suggesting that unique combinations of signaling  pathways are activated by R-Ras compared with other  members of the Ras superfamily.\n\nCurrently, it is not understood how different integrin  subunits specifically link to different inside-out or outside-in signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that R-Ras  can stimulate cellular migration that is dependent on the  alpha2beta1 or alpha4beta1 integrin, but not the alpha5beta1 integrin. In fact,  R-Ras activation seems to have a slight inhibitory effect  on alpha5beta1-mediated cell migration. The effect of R-Ras is  specifically on the alpha cytoplasmic domain since only this  domain differs between the X4C2 and X4C5 chimeras.  Our results are consistent with other observations that alpha  subunits appear to regulate the specificity and appropriateness of integrin response. For example, swapping integrin alpha cytoplasmic domains on the alpha2 integrin changes the  response of cells to collagen (XREF_BIBR), whereas  deletion of the alpha2 cytoplasmic domain causes unregulated  recruitment of integrins into focal complexes, even when  the cells are attached to fibronectin (XREF_BIBR). Here we are able to link a specific signaling pathway involving R-Ras to the alpha2beta1 integrin, which may help  explain these previous observations regarding specific alpha2  subunit effects. Activation of MAPK by integrins also depends on specific integrin subunits (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Specifically, alpha5beta1 integrin, but not alpha2beta1 integrin, associates with Shc and activates the MAPK pathway  in osteosarcoma cells (XREF_BIBR). The failure of  alpha2beta1 to couple to the MAPK pathway may partially explain why R-Ras-induced migration through alpha2beta1 was unaffected by MEK inhibition. Our results imply that cell migration will differ on different matrices, depending in part  on the signaling pathway that has been activated.\n\nOur finding that R-Ras enhances cell adhesion to collagen suggests that R-Ras enhances alpha2beta1 integrin avidity  for its ligand. An increase in integrin avidity is consistent  with the findings of XREF_BIBR. However, we find  that R-Ras enhances alpha2beta1- but not alpha5beta1-mediated adhesion, whereas Zhang et al. noted that R-Ras enhances adhesion to fibronectin through alpha4beta1, alpha5beta1, and alphavbeta3 integrins (XREF_BIBR). This difference could relate to  the difference between the myeloid cells used in those  studies and the epithelial cells used here. The R-Ras- induced increase in avidity determined by cell adhesion  could not be correlated to conformational changes of the  integrin as detected by the 12G10 anti-beta1 antibody. Other  investigators have also noted a lack of correlation between  ligand binding capability and beta1 conformation as detected  by various conformationally sensitive antibodies (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Our result could mean that R-Ras alters integrin conformation in  a manner not detected by this antibody. Alternatively,  changes in integrin avidity after R-Ras activation may not  be due to obvious conformational changes but to alterations in integrin clustering, adhesion strengthening, or cytoskeletal attachments.\n\nIt is not clear at this point how R-Ras stimulation differentiates between the alpha2 and alpha5 integrin subunits. An attractive model invokes proteins or factors that bind specifically to either the alpha2 or alpha5 integrin subunits. Stimulation  of R-Ras may alter the binding properties of such molecules, perhaps through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events or membrane targeting. These molecules could  bind to specific integrin subunits and activate their ligand  binding properties, or could alter integrin association with  the cytoskeleton. Alternatively, these factors could be inhibitory, such that R-Ras activation releases the integrin  subunit from inhibition by these factors. Our finding that  the X4C2 chimera blocks the R-Ras-induced migration of  cells on collagen, which is not a ligand for X4C2, suggests  that X4C2 acts as a dominant negative molecule in this  case, presumably through competition for these putative  integrin binding molecules. Such transdominant inhibition  has been suggested to explain how one integrin beta subunit  can inhibit the function of another (XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR) or how  chimeras expressing the cytoplasmic tail of the beta subunit  suppress integrin function (Y.P. XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Interestingly, transdominant beta1 integrin suppression can be overcome by expression of CD98 (XREF_BIBR), lending support to  the notion that accessory binding molecules regulate integrin function. To our knowledge, ours is the first demonstration of transdominant inhibition on alpha integrin subunits  and implies that factors bind not only to the beta, but also the  alpha cytoplasmic domains. Future studies should identify factors specific for the alpha2 cytoplasmic domain that may play a  role in R-Ras-enhanced integrin adhesion and migration.\n\nThe fact that R-Ras specifically enhances alpha2beta1 integrin- mediated migration and disrupts tubulogenesis is interesting in light of previous work specifically implicating the  alpha2beta1 integrin in these events in mammary epithelial cells  (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Thus affecting  alpha2beta1 function, either through changes in expression levels  or by inside-out signaling events, has important consequences for the phenotype of these cells. It is intriguing  that apparent increased function of the alpha2beta1 integrin by  R-Ras results in the same outcome of increased migration  and decreased cell polarization that is noted when alpha2beta1  levels are decreased (XREF_BIBR). This could indicate that R-Ras activation fundamentally changes the signaling pathways used by the alpha2beta1 integrin, disrupting the  normal signaling events that cause the cell to differentiate  and polarize in response to the extracellular matrix.  These same normal signaling events could be disrupted or  diminished when alpha2beta1 levels are decreased, as is noted in  breast carcinomas (XREF_BIBR). It will be interesting in future studies to determine exactly how cross-talk  between the alpha2beta1 integrin and R-Ras affects cellular differentiation, migration, and invasion.\n\nWe find a new role for endogenous R-Ras and TC21 in  the differentiation and migration of breast epithelial cells.  Dominant negative R-Ras inhibits basal cell migration,  suggesting that endogenous R-Ras plays a role in the migration of breast epithelial cells. Additionally, we find that  inhibitors of PI3K and PKC partially inhibit basal migration, consistent with our model that these molecules are  part of the mechanism by which R-Ras contributes to cell  migration, whether basal or induced. This further suggests  that the signaling pathways under investigation here are  likely relevant to understanding the migration of spontaneously occurring breast carcinomas. Dominant negative  isoforms of R-Ras or TC21 also enhance tubulogenesis in  three-dimensional collagen culture, indicating that antagonizing activated R-Ras or TC21 promotes differentiation.  This suggests that activated R-Ras and TC21 are negative  regulators of breast cell differentiation, consistent with the  finding that expression of activated R-Ras or TC21 isoforms disrupt tubulogenesis. These results could suggest  that activation of R-Ras and TC21 turns on signaling pathways that are incompatible with the decision of a cell to  slow proliferation and differentiate. Thus, inappropriate  activation of R-Ras or TC21 could result in a cell with a  more migratory and less differentiated phenotype, which  is consistent with a role in transformation.\n\nOur results add to the growing body of evidence pointing to an important role for PI3K in cellular migration  events (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). The effect of R-Ras on PI3K  possibly is direct since it has been shown that R-Ras binds  to PI3K in vitro and activates PI3K in Cos-7 cells (XREF_BIBR). Since R-Ras has direct effects on integrin  avidity, it is interesting that a role for PI3K in affecting integrin activation has been shown in lymphocytes (XREF_BIBR) and platelets (XREF_BIBR). Other  Ras superfamily members, including H-Ras, Cdc42, and  Rac, also bind and activate PI3K (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), which in  the case of H-Ras plays an important role in cellular transformation (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).  We previously found a role for PI3K in migration induced  by Rac and Cdc42 (XREF_BIBR) as well as by N- and  K-Ras (Keely, P., unpublished observation). Consistent  with these observations, expression of activated PI3K promotes migration and invasion (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).\n\nAlthough R-Ras is similar to Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 in its  use of a PI3K signaling pathway, it differs in its use of  other signaling pathways. Migration induced by R-Ras  or TC21 was only partially blocked by PI3K inhibitors;  this effect was much less dramatic than for migration induced by Rac and Cdc42, which could be completely  blocked by the same concentrations of these PI3K inhibitors (XREF_BIBR). This suggests that PI3K-independent signaling pathways also contribute to R-Ras- stimulated migration in these cells. Although MEK and  MAPK activation have been implicated in cell migration  in various cells (XREF_BIBR), we found that MEK  inhibition did not affect migration induced by R-Ras or  TC21. In contrast, MEK inhibition completely abolished  migration induced by K- and N-Ras. These results are consistent with observations that R-Ras activates PI3K but  not Raf (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), unlike H-, N-, and K-Ras, which activate both  PI3K and the Raf-MAPK pathway (XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR). Since a recent report suggests that the Raf-MAPK pathway might be involved in  transformation by TC21 (XREF_BIBR), our results  suggest that the mechanisms by which TC21 induces migration and transformation differ. Moreover, it appears  that different small GTPases stimulate cell migration by  activating different combinations of downstream signaling  pathways. The use of different signaling pathways may explain why R-Ras differs from N- and K-Ras in stimulating  migration across fibronectin.\n\nWe find a role for PKC, in addition to PI3K, in migration induced by R-Ras. Although certain isoforms of PKC  (delta, epsilon, and eta) can be activated downstream of PI3K and  contribute to cell migration (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), the additive effect of PI3K and PKC inhibitors in our assays suggests that PKC is on a separate pathway from PI3K in these cells. Whether PKC is downstream of R-Ras, or part of an independent obligate  pathway remains to be determined. To this end, we did not  observe an increase in in vitro PKC activity in cells expressing R-Ras in preliminary experiments (our unpublished observation), although translocation of PKC to the  membrane and subsequent activation in R-Ras-expressing  cells cannot be ruled out. Dominant negative R-Ras was  unable to block cell migration induced by PMA (our unpublished results), suggesting PKC is not upstream of  R-Ras in our system. In addition to R-Ras, we find a role  for PKC in migration induced by K-Ras. Others also have  noted synergy between PKC and small GTPases. The Rac  exchange factor, Tiam-1, can be activated by PKC (XREF_BIBR), which would place PKC upstream of Rac  activation. Similarly, PKC is upstream of Ras activation in  platelets (XREF_BIBR). Additionally, PKC activation  synergizes with Rho to induce focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, cell spreading, and actin assembly (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Interestingly, activation of  the alpha2beta1 integrin in monocytes by ligand binding to alpha5beta1  requires PKC (XREF_BIBR), which would be consistent with a model in which PKC is part of the pathway by  which R-Ras enhances avidity of the alpha2beta1 integrin. Moreover, PKC activation is involved in activation of the  alphaIIbbeta3 integrin by a number of agonists in platelets  (XREF_BIBR). Our results are also consistent  with other observations that PKC activity contributes to  cell migration (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).\n\nIn summary, we find that activation of R-Ras stimulates  unique combinations of downstream signaling pathways  compared with other GTPases of the Ras superfamily.  These unique signaling combinations lead to specific effects on certain integrin alpha subunits to alter cellular responses to collagen such as polarization, migration, and  invasion. Such specificity will decide how a cell might respond to different extracellular environments, depending  on which Ras family member is activated, and could ultimately determine if a given carcinoma is metastatic or not.  These differences have important implications for targeting signaling pathways in antimetastatic therapies since affecting certain signaling pathways may not have the desired effects on all neoplastic cells.\n\n","sentences":[{"words":["R-Ras","Signals","through","Specific","Integrin","alpha","Cytoplasmic","Domains","to","Promote","Migration","and","Invasion","of","Breast","Epithelial","Cells","."],"startOffsets":[0,6,14,22,31,40,46,58,66,70,78,88,92,101,104,111,122,128],"endOffsets":[5,13,21,30,39,45,57,65,68,77,87,91,100,103,110,121,127,129],"tags":["NNP","NNS","IN","JJ","NN","NN","JJ","NNS","TO","VB","NN","CC","NNP","IN","NN","JJ","NNS","."],"lemmas":["R-Ras","signal","through","specific","integrin","alpha","cytoplasmic","domain","to","promote","migration","and","Invasion","of","breast","epithelial","cell","."],"entities":["B-Gene_or_gene_product","I-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","B-Family","I-Family","O","O","O","O","O","O","B-BioProcess","O","B-CellType","I-CellType","I-CellType","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-VP","I-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":1,"destination":2,"relation":"prep"},{"source":2,"destination":4,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"amod"},{"source":5,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":5,"destination":7,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":5,"destination":9,"relation":"xcomp"},{"source":7,"destination":6,"relation":"amod"},{"source":9,"destination":8,"relation":"aux"},{"source":9,"destination":10,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":10,"destination":11,"relation":"cc"},{"source":10,"destination":12,"relation":"conj"},{"source":12,"destination":13,"relation":"prep"},{"source":13,"destination":16,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":16,"destination":15,"relation":"amod"},{"source":16,"destination":14,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[5]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":1,"destination":4,"relation":"prep_through"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"amod"},{"source":5,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":5,"destination":7,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":5,"destination":9,"relation":"xcomp"},{"source":7,"destination":6,"relation":"amod"},{"source":9,"destination":8,"relation":"aux"},{"source":9,"destination":10,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":9,"destination":12,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":10,"destination":12,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":12,"destination":16,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":16,"destination":15,"relation":"amod"},{"source":16,"destination":14,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[5]}}},{"words":["Specificity","and","modulation","of","integrin","function","have","important","consequences","for","cellular","responses","to","the","extracellular","matrix",",","including","differentiation","and","transformation","."],"startOffsets":[133,145,149,160,163,172,181,186,196,209,213,222,232,235,239,253,259,261,271,287,291,305],"endOffsets":[144,148,159,162,171,180,185,195,208,212,221,231,234,238,252,259,260,270,286,290,305,306],"tags":["NN","CC","NN","IN","NN","NN","VBP","JJ","NNS","IN","JJ","NNS","TO","DT","JJ","NN",",","VBG","NN","CC","NN","."],"lemmas":["specificity","and","modulation","of","integrin","function","have","important","consequence","for","cellular","response","to","the","extracellular","matrix",",","include","differentiation","and","transformation","."],"entities":["O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","B-Cellular_component","I-Cellular_component","O","O","B-BioProcess","O","O","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":0,"destination":1,"relation":"cc"},{"source":0,"destination":2,"relation":"conj"},{"source":0,"destination":3,"relation":"prep"},{"source":3,"destination":5,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":5,"destination":4,"relation":"nn"},{"source":6,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":6,"destination":8,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":6,"destination":12,"relation":"prep"},{"source":8,"destination":7,"relation":"amod"},{"source":8,"destination":9,"relation":"prep"},{"source":9,"destination":11,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":11,"destination":10,"relation":"amod"},{"source":12,"destination":15,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":15,"destination":17,"relation":"prep"},{"source":15,"destination":13,"relation":"det"},{"source":15,"destination":14,"relation":"amod"},{"source":17,"destination":18,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":18,"destination":19,"relation":"cc"},{"source":18,"destination":20,"relation":"conj"}],"roots":[6]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":0,"destination":2,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":0,"destination":5,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":5,"destination":4,"relation":"nn"},{"source":6,"destination":15,"relation":"prep_to"},{"source":6,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":6,"destination":2,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":6,"destination":8,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":8,"destination":7,"relation":"amod"},{"source":8,"destination":11,"rel
