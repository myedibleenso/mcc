Mutations in K-Ras are found in nearly all cases, but K-Ras mutations alone are not sufficient for the development of PDAC. Additional factors contribute to activation of Ras signaling and lead to tumor formation. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a multifunctional beta-galactoside-binding protein, is highly expressed in PDAC. We therefore investigated the functional role of Gal-3 in pancreatic cancer progression and its relationship to Ras signaling. Expression of Gal-3 was determined by immunohistochemistry, Q-PCR and immunoblot. Functional studies were performed using pancreatic cell lines genetically engineered to express high or low levels of Gal-3. Ras activity was examined by Raf pull-down assays. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were used to assess protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that Gal-3 was highly up-regulated in human tumors and in a mutant K-Ras mouse model of PDAC. Down-regulation of Gal-3 by lentivirus shRNA decreased PDAC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and reduced tumor volume and size in an orthotopic mouse model. Gal-3 bound Ras and maintained Ras activity; down-regulation of Gal-3 decreased Ras activity as well as Ras down-stream signaling including phosphorylation of ERK and AKT and Ral A activity. Transfection of Gal-3 cDNA into PDAC cells with low-level Gal-3 augmented Ras activity and its down-stream signaling. These results suggest that Gal-3 contributes to pancreatic cancer progression, in part, by binding Ras and activating Ras signaling. Gal-3 may therefore be a potential novel target for this deadly disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death, with an estimated 43,140 new cases and 36,800 deaths in the United States XREF_BIBR. Because of its aggressive growth, early metastatic dissemination and the lack of effective therapies, the five-year survival rate for this disease remains at 3-5% XREF_BIBR. Considerable effort has therefore been made to understand the molecular events which may drive the pathogenesis of PDAC. Among the numerous molecular alterations identified in PDAC, mutations in the pro-oncogene K-Ras are found in nearly all cases XREF_BIBR and is an early event for the development of PDAC XREF_BIBR. K-Ras mutations alone are not sufficient for the development of PDAC. K-Ras mutations are often found in chronic pancreatitis and may even be found in normal individuals XREF_BIBR. Moreover, K-Ras mutation in a mouse model with low Ras activity does not spontaneously lead to development of PDAC XREF_BIBR, while K-Ras mutation in a mouse model with a high level of Ras activity is associated with rapid development of CP with abundant fibrosis and progression to PDAC which mimics human disease XREF_BIBR. It has therefore been proposed that it is the activity of K-Ras rather than the presence of mutation per se which is the biologically relevant parameter associated with the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer XREF_BIBR. Additional factors are required that contribute to Ras activity; however, the mechanisms by which Ras activity is further activated are largely unknown.\n\nGalectin-3 (Gal-3), a b-galactoside-binding protein exhibits pleiotropic biological and pathological functions, and has been implicated in cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, RNA processing and malignant transformation XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. Gal-3 is found in multiple cellular compartments including the cytoplasm, the cell surface, the nucleus, and Gal-3 is also secreted XREF_BIBR. The significance of Gal-3 expression has been evaluated in many cancer types including pancreatic cancer XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. Several studies have indicated that Gal-3 mRNA is up-regulated in pancreatic tumor tissues compared to control tissues XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, and transient suppression of galectin-3 has been reported to induce pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion XREF_BIBR. Wang et al found that Gal-3 was also up-regulated in chronic pancreatitis and suggested that it was involved in both extracellular matrix (ECM) changes and ductal complex formation XREF_BIBR. However, the full significance of Gal-3 in PDAC remains unclear and little is known about the possible function mechanisms of Gal-3 in the pathogenesis of the PDAC. Recently, Kloog and colleagues demonstrated that K-RAS GTP recruits Gal-3 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where it becomes an integral nanocluster component. The cytosolic level of Gal-3 determines the magnitude of K-Ras GTP nanoclustering and signal output in breast cancer cells XREF_BIBR. More recently, observations from same group demonstrated that K-Ras association with Gal-3 contributes to thyroid malignancy XREF_BIBR. Since mutations in K-Ras are nearly universal in PDAC and the activity level of Ras appears to be a key mechanism controlling the development of PDAC, we sought to determine whether Gal-3 affects Ras activity contributing to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.\n\nIn this study, we systematically evaluated the expression of Gal-3 in 120 paired human pancreatic tissues from normal pancreas, pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors, and for the first time determined the expression of Gal-3 in tissues and tumor cells derived from of a mutant K-Ras mouse model of pancreatic cancer. We have extended the results of previous studies, and further delineated the function of Gal-3 in vivo and in vitro with regard to pancreatic cancer formation. Gal-3 expression was increased in pancreatic cancers and cancer cells, and stimulated pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion and promoted tumor growth. Gal-3 binds Ras and enhances Ras activity and down-stream signaling. These observations support the conclusion that Gal-3 may be a potential novel target for this deadly disease.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nGal-3 is highly up-regulated in human pancreatic tumor tissues.\n\nGene expression profiling studies suggest that Gal-3 is up-regulated in pancreatic tumors compared to control tissues XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. We performed immunohistochemical staining of human pancreatic tissue microarrays with anti-Gal3 antibody (XREF_FIG). We found that Gal-3 expression progressively increased in the sequence of disease progression normal (XREF_FIG), pancreatitis (c,d) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (e,f). Gal-3 staining was categorized into two groups, Gal-3 Low (score <3) and Gal-3-high (score >4), based on the staining intensity and positive staining percentage as described in Materials and Methods. We found that 83 of 125 (66.4%) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples showed high levels of Gal-3 expression (Gal3-high). Among these cases, paired non-neoplastic pancreatic tissues were available for evaluation in 108 cases (72 samples of chronic pancreatitis and 36 normal pancreatic tissue samples) and 32 (29.6%) were Gal3-high. Gal-3 expression was significantly higher in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma than the paired non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue samples (p<0.0001). 28 of 72 (38.9%) chronic pancreatitis samples were Gal3-high compared to 11.1% (4/36) of normal pancreatic tissue samples (P<0.001) (XREF_FIG). These data indicate that Gal-3 is up-regulated during the human pancreatic disease progression normal, pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n\nGal-3 is highly up-regulated in pancreatic tumor tissues and cells from a K-Ras mutant mouse model.\n\nA recently described mutant K-Ras mouse model recapitulates the human pancreatic cancer progression sequence from inflammation to PanIN to PDAC XREF_BIBR. It was of interest to determine whether this mouse model would also mimic the changes in Gal-3 expression observed in human samples. As shown in XREF_FIG, Gal-3 was undetectable in pancreas tissues from normal mice (lanes 1-3), but highly up-regulated in seven tumor cell lines (lanes 4-10) which were derived from seven different mouse tumors.\n\nIn order to determine if Gal-3 mRNA was also up-regulated in mouse tumor tissues compared with normal and pancreatitis tissues, tissues from individual mice that were normal, had pancreatitis or those with tumors were extracted and real-time PCR was performed using specific mouse Gal-3 primers (Mm00802901_m1, Ambion, USA) (XREF_FIG). We observed that Gal-3 expression was low in normal pancreatic tissues (lanes 1-3), but was increased 10-27 fold in chronic pancreatitis (lanes 4-9) and increased 45-215 fold in K-RAS mutant mouse tumor tissues (lanes 10-12). Gal-3 mRNA levels were even higher (62 fold to 831 fold), when measured in isolated tumor cells (lanes 13-24).\n\n\n\nGeneration of Gal-3 over- and under-expressing PDAC Cells.\n\nIn order to manipulate Gal-3 levels in PADC cells, we first determined the level of Gal-3 expression in a variety of PADC cell lines (XREF_FIG, top panel). MPanc96, MIAPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells had high basal Gal-3 expression (XREF_FIG) and were stably transfected with lentivirus Gal-3 shRNA (A3 cells) or vector only (GN10 cells). Galectin-3 levels were successfully reduced in Miapaca-2, Panc-1 and Mpan96 cells 90%, 95% and 92% respectively (XREF_FIG, middle panel). In order to study the effects of up-regulation of galectin-3, Gal-3 cDNA lentivirus were transfected into PDAC cells with lower basal Gal-3 levels (XREF_FIG, lower panel). These variants were designated as L-gal3 and V (vector control) as shown in XREF_FIG, lower panel. These PDAC cells were used to further determine the function of Gal-3 in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n\nGal-3 regulates cell proliferation, invasion and colony formation in PADC cells in vitro.\n\nIn order to determine if Gal-3 plays a functional role in pancreatic tumor cell behavior in vitro, we utilized cell lines genetically altered to express different Gal-3 levels as shown in XREF_FIG to determine the effects of Gal-3 on tumor cell growth (MTS assay), invasion (Matrigel invasion assay) and in vitro tumorigenicity (soft agar colony formation assay). Knock down of Gal-3 in Miapaca-2 and Mpanc96 cells significantly decreased cell growth at 72 hours (XREF_FIG, top panel). In a complementary experiment, over-expression of Gal-3 in L3.6PL and BXPC-3 cells (L3.6PL-L-gal3 and BXPC-3-L-gal3) increased cell proliferation compared with control cells L3.6PL-V and BXPC-3-V (XREF_FIG, Lower panel). To investigate whether Gal-3 affects the invasive capabilities of PDAC cells, Matrigel invasion assays were performed. Downregulation of Gal-3 (A3) in MPanc96 and Miapaca-2 cells decreased cell invasion by 95% and 90% respectively compared with control cells (XREF_FIG). In contrast, Gal3 cDNA expressed cells BXPC-3 L-gal3 increased cell invasion capacity (data not shown). These results indicate that Gal-3 also plays an important role in the invasion of PDC cells.\n\nIn addition, down-regulation of Gal-3 by shRNA in MPanc96 cells (MPanc96 A3) dramatically decreased colony numbers in soft agar compared with vector-transfected controls (XREF_FIG top panels), while up-regulation of Gal-3 in BXPC-3 cells significantly increased colony numbers compared with controls (XREF_FIG lower panels). These data indicate that Gal-3 levels influence PDAC cell proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent growth.\n\n\n\nDownregulation of Gal-3 inhibits tumor growth in an in vivo orthotopic model.\n\nTo investigate the influence of Gal-3 levels on in vivo growth of PDAC, MPanc96 cells stably transfected with Gal-3 shRNA or a control shRNA vector were labeled with firefly luciferase to allow real-time bioluminescence imaging to monitor tumor volume and spread in vivo. These cells were orthotopically injected into the body of the pancreas of nude mice, and tumor growth was monitored by non-invasive imaging once per week. Differences in the growth of the tumors were noted within 3 weeks (representative images as shown in XREF_FIG). Quantitative evaluation of tumor burden indicated that tumors were significantly larger in the control group compared to the Gal-3 knock down group (XREF_FIG) (p<0.05). In addition, primary tumor weights were significantly less in the Gal3 knock down group than the control group as demonstrated in XREF_FIG; Immunohistochemical staining for Gal-3, Ras and phospho-ERK in these mice tumor tissues (XREF_FIG) further confirmed that expression of Gal-3, Ras and the down-stream effector phospho-ERK are decreased in the Gal-3 knock down group compared with the control group. Regional micrometastases were noted in animals injected with control cells (5/5 animals), but not in animals injected with cells in which galectin-3 had been knocked down by stable transfection of galectin-3 shRNA (0/5 animals) (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY).\n\n\n\nGal-3 binds to Ras and increases Ras activity in PDAC cells.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Gal-3 is associated with activated K-Ras and promotes strong activation of Raf-1 and PI3-K but attenuates activation of ERK signaling in COS cells XREF_BIBR. We therefore hypothesized that Gal-3 would bind with Ras and mediate Ras activity in PDAC cells characterized by the frequent occurrence of Ras mutations. Using an antibody array (Hypromatrix, Worcester, MA), we detected the interaction between Ras and Gal-3 using HA tagged Gal3 transfected BXPC-3 lysate (data not shown). Ras was confirmed to be one of the binding partners of Gal-3 based on data from the antibody array. To further confirm that Ras interacts with Gal-3, we used co-immunoprocipitation assays. Lysates from Panc-1 and MPanc96 with or without knock down of Gal-3 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either Gal3 rat monoclonal antibody or a pan anti-Ras monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-Ras or ant-Gal3 antibodies. Results demonstrated that Gal-3 co-immunoprecipitated with Ras, while lysates with normal IgG yielded no visible band (XREF_FIG).\n\nTo further determine if interaction between Ras and Gal-3 affects Ras activity, we examined the effects of manipulating Gal-3 expression on Ras activity. As shown in XREF_FIG, down-regulation of Gal-3 in Panc-1 and MPan96 cells (A3) decreased Ras activity using the Ras-GTP assay, while overexpression of Gal3 in BXPC-3 cells increased Ras GTP activity (XREF_FIG). In order to further elucidate how Gal-3 mediates Ras activity, cell membrane and cytosolic proteins were isolated XREF_BIBR from Panc-1 and MPanc96 control cell (GN10) and knock down cells (A3) and Ras protein was detected using immunoblotting. Less Ras protein was detected in the plasma membranes of Panc-1 A3 cells and Mpanc96 A3 cells compared to control GN10 cells (XREF_FIG). In contract, more RAS protein was observed in the cytosol of Panc-1 and Mpanc96 A3 cells compared to control GN10 cells. These data suggest that Gal-3 may govern Ras subcellular localization. Confocal immunofluorescence confirmed that up-regulation of Gal-3 in BXPC-3 cells is associated with increased Ras at the plasma membrane (XREF_FIG).This suggests that Gal-3 binds Ras and is responsible for Ras attachment to the cell plasma membrane, thereby mediating its activity.\n\n\n\nGal-3 mediates Ras downstream signaling in PDAC cells.\n\nActivated Ras (GTP-bound state) activates downstream effectors including the Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK), phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT, and RalA pathways to induce a range of cellular responses including proliferation, migration and transformation. We therefore wished to determine the effects of Gal-3 on Ras down-stream signaling. Downregulation of Gal-3 in MPanc96 pancreatic cancer cells was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and also RalA-GTP activity (XREF_FIG, left panel). Silencing Gal-3 also reduced known Ras target genes including beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and C-MYC (XREF_FIG), In contrast, up-regulation of Gal-3 in BXPC-3 cells with low basal Gal-3 expression increased phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, and RalA activity as well as the expression of beta-catenin, cyclinD1 and C-MYC (right panel). This suggests that down-regulation of Gal-3 decreases Ras down-stream signalings (left panel); while up-regulation of Gal-3 increases Ras down-stream signaling (right panel).\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nGalectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of the animal lectin family, is up-regulated in many tumors including pancreatic cancer XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Its importance in pancreatic cancer, a tumor characterized by frequent Ras mutation, however, remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that Gal-3 in pancreatic cancer tissue and cells, whether mouse or human, is highly elevated. Our data suggests that elevated Gal-3 in pancreatic tumor cells with mutant K-Ras further increases Ras activity by binding Ras to the plasma membrane, where mediates its downstream effectors including Raf/MEK/ERK,PI3K/AKT and RalA (XREF_FIG), thereby inducing pancreatic cancer cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Gal-3 expression has been previously reported to be elevated in human pancreatic tumors compared with normal tissues, although the clinical significance of this finding has been unclear XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. In the current study, we confirm that expression of Gal-3 is elevated in human pancreatic tumor tissues in a larger tissue microarray set, as well as in a mouse model of pancreatic tumorigenesis which mimics the human condition XREF_BIBR. In this model, mice with mutations in the K-Ras gene develop chronic pancreatitis, acinar to ductal metaplasia and a high incidence of PDAC at a relative early ageXREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Our findings demonstrate that mutant K-Ras is associated with high Gal-3 expression in this model, This is in agreement with previous findings that Gal-3 expression increased in Ras transformed NIH3T3 cells, human HOS cells XREF_BIBR and in p53 mutant cells XREF_BIBR.\n\nWe have demonstrated that down-regulation of Gal-3 by ShRNA in several pancreatic cancer cell lines with high constitutive Gal-3 expression decreases cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumor volume and size in vivo in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse model. This finding further suggests that elevated Gal-3 in tumor cells plays an important functional role in tumor cell growth and invasion. A recent publication by Kobayashi et al XREF_BIBR reported that transient gene silencing of galectin-3 suppresses pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion, but failed to affect proliferation. The discrepancy between our findings and those reported by these authors could be due to different degrees of galectin-3 inhibition. In our study lentivirus-shRNA was used to generate stable clones in which the efficiency of knock down is robust and stable, while Kobayashi et al employed transient silencing of galectin-3. Hann et. al. XREF_BIBR studied a variety of pancreatic cell lines in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous xenografts) after manipulation of galectin-3 levels and concluded that galectin-3 had no consistant oncogenic function in pancreatic cancer cells. While this group did not note a universal effect on in vitro characteristics such as proliferation, migration or anchorage independent growth after transient tranfection of galectin-3 si-RNA in all cells lines, there was a moderate effect in several cell lines. Both our report and that of Kobayashi et. al. XREF_BIBR provide clear evidence for an effect of galectin-3 on cell migration and invasion, properties associated with tumor progression. Lack of effect of galectin-3 knockdown on growth of subcutaneous xenografts is interepreted by these authors as evidence for a lack of effect of galectin-3 on oncogenic function. Using orthotopic implantation into the pancreatic bed, a model which better recapitulates in vivo pancreatic tumor growth, we have clearly demonstrated an effect of galectin-3 on pancreatic tumor growth.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms by which Gal-3 mediates cell proliferation and invasion in pancreatic cancer are unclear. Studies in human breast cancer cells XREF_BIBR have demonstrated that Gal-3 mediates K-Ras GTP nanocluster formation and its signal output and the transformed phenotype of breast cancer cells XREF_BIBR. It has been recently demonstrated that K-Ras GTP in association with Gal-3 contributes to the development of thyroid carcinoma, and that the Ras inhibitor FTS disrupts the interactions between K-Ras and Gal-3 and inhibits thyroid tumor growth XREF_BIBR. Since mutations in K-Ras are nearly universal in PDAC and Gal-3 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells in both human and K-Ras mutant mouse, we asked whether elevated Gal-3 levels may further mediate or augment Ras activity in pancreatic cancer cells. Our results suggest that Gal-3 levels modulate Ras activity in pancreatic cancer cells, since down-regulation of Gal-3 decreases Ras activity while up-regulation of Gal-3 increases Ras activity in pancreatic cancer cells. Using antibody array based screens and immunoprecipitation assays, we found that Gal-3 can bind to Ras in pancreatic cancer cells and retain Ras in the plasma membrane where it activates its downstream signaling. These findings are consistant with previous findings in which breast cancer cells were studied XREF_BIBR. Kloog and colleagues have studied the role of galectins by manipulation of cultured NIH3T3 cells, embryonic fibrobasts, breast cancer cell lines and thyroid cancer cell lines XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. Recent study from Levy R at al demonstrated galectin-3 mediates cross-talk between K-Ras and Let-7c tumor suppressor miRNA XREF_BIBR. These studies for the most part examine the effects of galectin-3 on signaling pathways in cultured cells, or infer an effect on oncogenic function using in vitro assays such as anchorage independence or resistance to apoptosis, or in the case of thyroid cancer subcutaneous growth. We believe that our use of complementary in vitro and in vivo systems (including a mutant K-ras mouse mode and orthotopic implantation) with a special emphasis on pancreatic carcinogenesis (where abnormal K-ras is clearly functionally important) adds important information to the existing literature.\n\nRas mutations are early and prevalent genetic events in pancreatic cancer development. However, K-Ras mutations have also been observed in 30-40% of samples from patients with CP and may even be present in normal individuals XREF_BIBR. Low levels of mutant K-Ras activity may not be sufficient to meet a threshold of pathologic Ras signaling necessary for tumorigenesis. Based on our results it is possible that up-regulation of Gal-3 may feed forward to promote Ras oncogenic signaling by binding Ras and augmenting its downstream signaling (XREF_FIG).\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that Gal-3 is highly up-regulated in pancreatic tumor tissues and cells in both human pancreas and in a K-Ras mutant mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Our data suggest that up-regulated Gal-3 in tumor tissues further enhances Ras activity by binding and retaining Ras at the plasma membrane, thereby activating down-stream Ras signaling. Gal-3 may therefore play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, in which Ras mutations frequently occur.
