[BMB Reports 2014; 47(12): 685-690]\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nRas is a small GTP-binding protein that is involved in transmitting extracellular signals within cells. The Ras signaling pathway is important for regulation of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. Three different Ras proteins are known: H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras. Upon growth factor stimulation, Ras is activated through the nucleotide exchange of GDP for GTP by guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor son of seven less (SOS). Activated Ras stimulates Raf kinases, which leads to activation of MAPK/Erk kinase (MEK). MEK is a dual-specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates Erk1/2 (p42/p44 MAP kinase) on both threonine and tyrosine in a conserved Thr-X-Tyr motif XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Activated Erk phosphorylates several cytosolic signaling molecules, including p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus where it regulates many downstream targets, including the transcription factors Elk-1 and c-Jun, resulting in regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The qualitative and quantitative features of Erk1/2 activity determine the physiological response to any given mitogenic or stress stimulus XREF_BIBR. Sustained Erk phosphorylation by nerve growth factor (NGF) induces differentiation, while transient Erk phosphorylation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates cell proliferation in PC12 cells XREF_BIBR. Thus, Erk1/2 phosphorylation status is strictly regulated by several positive and negative regulatory loops XREF_BIBR.\n\nParadoxically, lack of Erk MAPK activation is observed in several cancer cells despite active activation of Ras XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. MAPK phosphatase (MKP) belongs to the dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family that functions as a negative regulator of MAPK activity by dephosphorylating both the phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues in the Thr-X-Tyr motif of MAPKs. The human genome contains around 30 DUSP genes, and the various members of the MKP family have distinct specificities for Erk1/2 in either the cytoplasm (e.g., PP2A, MKP3/DUSP6/Pyst1 and MKP-X/DUSP7/Pyst2) or the nucleus (e.g., MKP1/DUSP1, PAC-1/DUSP2, B23/hVH3/DUSP5, and MKP4/DUSP9/Pyst3) XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. In general, MKP3 is highly specific to cytoplasmic Erk1/2 and is involved in preventing nuclear translocation of Erk1/2 XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which active Ras leads to decreased Erk1/2 activity by using NIH3T3 cells conditionally expressing active H-Ras under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoter. We found that prolonged expression of active Ras resulted in up-regulation of the MKP3 gene via the PI3K/Akt pathway.\n\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION.\n\nWe previously described a NIH3T3 cell line (NIH3T3tet-on/HRasG12R), in which the expression of active Ras (H-RasG12R) can be induced by addition of doxycycline XREF_BIBR. In this model system, the active Ras protein was detectable 24 h after the addition of 2 mug/ml doxycycline (XREF_FIGA). Despite the continual increase in the level of active Ras, the levels of Erk1/2 phosphorylation gradually decreased after peaking at 12 h after doxycycline addition. However, Akt and Raf1, an upstream kinase of Erk1/2, phosphorylation was still increased due to expression of active Ras. To determine whether growth factor stimulation of Erk1/2 could also be affected due to sustained activation of Ras, NIH3T3tet-on/H-RasG12R cells were cultured in medium containing 0.5% serum in both the absence and presence of doxycycline, and then stimulated with FGF2 for 30 min (XREF_FIGB). The level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation was increased by FGF2 in both untreated and treated cells with doxycycline for 12 h, but not in cells treated with doxycycline for 48 h, although the basal Erk1/2 phosphorylation level was similar to that in cells treated with doxycycline for 12 h. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 down-stream targets, such as p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK; MAPKAPK1A) and transcription factor Elk-1, was not increased by FGF2 in cells treated with doxycycline for 48 h.\n\nWe next assessed the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated Erk1/2 following doxycycline treatment. Phopho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity was highly enriched in the nucleus following FGF2 treatment in control cultures. In contrast, Erk1/2 phosphorylation was marked in the cytosol, but sparse in the nucleus of doxycycline-treated cells (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that prolonged Ras activation impairs the nuclear levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2 in NIH3T3 cells.\n\nMKP3 is a Thr/Tyr dual-specific phosphatase of Erk1/2 that prevents nuclear translocation of Erk1/2 XREF_BIBR. It has been reported that MKP3 is induced by Erk1/2 upon fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) stimulation in NIH3T3 cells XREF_BIBR, suggesting that growth factor-induced Erk1/2 activity could be controlled by negative feedback loops via Erk1/2-specific MKP3 expression. To investigate whether sustained Ras activation impairs phosphorylated Erk1/2 levels in the nucleus through induction of MKP3, NIH3T3tet-on/H-RasG12R cells were exposed to doxycycline and MKP3 mRNA levels were examined by Northern blot analysis. A time kinetic study showed that MKP3 mRNA was detectable within 3 h after doxycycline addition (XREF_FIGA). MKP3 protein was also increased by doxycycline treatment and coincided with a reduction in Erk1/2 phosphorylation (XREF_FIGB). To determine whether induction of MKP3 mRNA by active Ras occurred at the transcriptional level, the 5'-regulatory region of the MKP3 gene (nucleotides from -1597 to -10 relative to the transcription start site) was isolated and sub-cloned into a pGL3-Luc reporter vector. Transient co-transfection of active H-RasV12 and pMkp3-Luc(-1597/-10) into NIH3T3 cells led to a concentration-dependent increase in promoter reporter activity, while dominant-negative RasN17 had no effect (XREF_FIGC). Thus, long-term activation of the Ras signaling pathway up-regulates MKP3 expression at the transcriptional level in NIH3T3 fibroblasts.\n\nActive Ras can stimulate multiple effector pathways, including Raf and PI3K XREF_BIBR. Numerous reports have demonstrated that MKP3 expression is dependent on Erk1/2 activity in several cell types, including NIH3T3, human pancreatic cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer cells XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. The PI3K pathway also inhibits Erk1/2 activity through up-regulation of MKP3 expression in response to FGF8 stimulation during limb development XREF_BIBR. These studies have suggested that multiple signaling pathways are involved in MKP3 expression. To determine the downstream signaling pathway of active Ras involved in MKP3 expression, we utilized pharmacological inhibitors. Treatment with either the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) or the Akt inhibitor (API-2) blocked doxycycline-induced accumulation of MKP3, which led to the partial recovery of the phosphorylation status of Erk1/2 (XREF_FIGA), suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism. Interestingly, treatment with the MEK inhibitor (U0126) caused a dramatic reduction in the level of phosphorylated Erk1/2, but only slightly prevented MKP3 accumulation. Moreover, doxycycline-induced MKP3 promoter activity was strongly inhibited by LY294002 or API-2, whereas only slightly, but significantly, inhibited in the presence of U0126 (XREF_FIGB). In contrast, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin had no significant effect on doxycycline-induced MKP3 promoter activity. We next assessed the effect of forced expression of PI3K. Transient transfection of active RasV12, p110-CAAX (constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K), or Akt led to a strong increase in reporter activity of the pMkp3-Luc(-1597/-10) construct (XREF_FIGC). Furthermore, RasV12-induced MKP3 promoter activity was significantly abrogated by expression of dominant negative (DN)-Akt (XREF_FIGD). These data suggest that the PI3K pathway plays a critical role in MKP3 expression induced by active Ras activation.\n\nThe present study proposes a novel mechanism by which prolonged activation of active Ras can modulate Erk1/2 activity through induction of the MKP3 gene in NIH3T3 cells. Activated PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 phosphate (PIP 3 ), which promotes membrane localization of PI-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), leading to the activation of Akt, which in turn, can cause the activation or inhibition of specific target proteins involved in transcription, translation, cell growth, and survival. Ras positively cross-talks through direct interaction with the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K to promote PI3K pathway activation XREF_BIBR. In addition, constitutive Ras activation can promote the down-regulation of PTEN, a lipid phosphatase which counterbalances the effects of PI3K by removing the phosphate from PIP 3 \nXREF_BIBR. On the contrary, Akt can inhibit the Raf through phosphorylation on Ser-259 XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. These findings suggest that the Ras and PI3K pathways can be mutually regulated by several cross-talk mechanisms in different cellular contexts. Taking these observations into consideration, our data suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway transmits the active Ras signal to MKP3 expression, which in turn leads to the down-regulation of the Erk1/2 activity in NIH3T3 cells. On the contrary, it has been reported that negative feedback regulation of FGF signaling (FGF2/4/8) is not mediated by the PI3K pathway, but by an Erk1/2-dependent Ets transcription factor, in MKP3 expression XREF_BIBR. This discrepancy might be due to the different cellular contexts. High levels of constitutively active Ras may affect multiple signaling pathways that are not activated by normal Ras XREF_BIBR. It is speculated that transient activation of Ras by growth factor signaling may induce MKP3 expression through an Erk1/2-dependent Ets-family transcription factor, but sustained activation of Ras may preferentially use the PI3K-dependent pathway to induce MKP3 expression.\n\nIn summary, we showed that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway negatively regulates Erk1/2 through induction of MKP3 expression in NIH3T3 cells expressing constitutively active Ras. However, it remains possible that other MKPs of the DUSP family could affect active Ras-induced Erk1/2 activity. An understanding of the precise molecular mechanism of the negative feedback loop induced by active Ras would be beneficial to the design of future therapeutic development against active Ras-mediated
