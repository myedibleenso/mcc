In this study, its effects on ras-mutated pancreatic cancer cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Two human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 (mutated K-ras) and BxPC-3 (wild-type K-ras) were selected to test the effects of rasfonin on cell proliferation, clone formation, migration and invasion in vitro. Immunoblotting was used to detect the expressions of EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway proteins. Ras activity was measured using a pull-down ELISA kit and guanine exchange factor (GEF)/GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) activity was measured by [ 3 H]-GDP radiometric ligand binding. For an in vivo study, CD1 nude mice bearing Panc-1 cells were treated with rasfonin or Salirasib (FTS). We found that rasfonin suppressed proliferation more strongly in Panc-1 cells (IC 50 =5.5muM) than BxPC-3 cells (IC 50 =10muM) in vitro. Clone formation, migration and invasion by Panc-1 cells were also reduced by rasfonin. Rasfonin had little effect on the farnesylation of Ras, but it strongly downregulated Ras activity and consequently phosphorylation of c-Raf/MEK/ERK. Further experiments indicated that rasfonin reduced Son of sevenless (Sos1) expression but did not alter GEF and GAP activities. The in vivo experiments also revealed that rasfonin (30mg/kg) delayed the growth of xenograft tumors originating from Panc-1 cells. Tumor weight was ultimately decreased after 20 days of treatment of rasfonin. Rasfonin is a robust inhibitor of pancreatic cancers with the K-ras mutation. The reduction of Sos1 expression and the consequently depressed Ras-MAPK activity could be important in its anticancer activity.\n\n\n\nCancer is projected to become the leading cause of mortality worldwide in 2010 and cancer cases are expected to double by 2020. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in the USA, accounting for 6% of all cancer deaths. In the USA, the estimated number of new cases of pancreatic cancer in 2009 was 42000, with an estimated 35000 deaths. The current 5-year survival rate is 5%. In the EU, pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of mortality, accounting for approximately 7% of all cancer deaths per year. 1  Gemcitabine has been a standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer since it was found a decade ago to result in a better clinical response and survival than bolus 5-fluorouracil. However, its curative effect is far from satisfactory when used alone, because patients succumb to their disease in <6 months.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR\n\nRas is a family of genes involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and apoptosis. Each mammalian cell contains at least three genes, H-ras, K-ras and N-ras. Generally speaking, to acquire malignancy, pancreatic cancer cells undergo a series of sequential genetic mutations. Among the initial events are K-ras mutation.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR It has been reported that K-ras gene mutation occurs in more than 90% of pancreatic cancers. 7  This mutation results in constitutive activation of the protein, which no longer requires a ligand for activation. In fact, many growth factors and mitogens use the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade to transmit signals from their receptors. After cytokines, growth factors or mitogens have bound to their appropriate receptors, the coupling complex growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2)/Son of sevenless (Sos1) is activated. Sos1, the membrane-associated guanine exchange factor (GEF), shifts the equilibrium from inactive Ras-GDP to the active Ras-GTP form.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR Importantly, growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2), through its SH3 motif, binds and transports Sos1 to the plasma membrane to initiate Ras activation.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR The GTP-bound active Ras can then recruit Raf to the cell membrane, sequentially activating the MAP kinases. Dynamic termination of growth signaling occurs when Ras, through its intrinsic GTPase activity, cycles back to its GDP-bound, inactive state. Intrinsic Ras-GTPase activity is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR\n\nRasfonin (XREF_FIG) is a novel 2-pyrone derivative isolated from the fermented mycelium of Talaromyces species 3656-A1. 13  It is named after the protein Ras since its biological activity is elicited in cells that depend on Ras for growth. Recent studies have indicated that rasfonin selectively destroys ras-dependent Ba/F3-V12 cells with an IC 50  of 0.37muM. Exposure to higher concentrations of rasfonin (2.3muM) resulted in a considerable number of cells exhibiting condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei, the typical markers of apoptosis. However, a non-ras-dependent cell line was unaffected by rasfonin at concentrations up to 2.88muM. The selective inducers of apoptosis in ras-dependent cells could represent a novel class of cancer chemotherapeutics useful for treating tumors expressing constitutively active, mutant ras. 14  In view of this effect, we presume rasfonin holds further promise for treating K-ras mutation pancreatic cancers. However, the reported methods for synthesizing rasfonin have many disadvantages such as low yield, poor selectivity and complex manipulation problems, and could not provide a simple way of obtaining sufficient of the product for our experiments. We therefore initiated a chemical investigation of the fungus Doratomyces sp. (Genebank accession number JQ284031) isolated from a soil sample collected in April, 2007 on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau at an altitude above 4347m, Linzhi, Tibet, China. Its HPLC-PDA fingerprints demonstrated that the major component was rasfonin (Chinese patent: 201110453153.8), and its structure was readily identified by comparing the NMR and MS data with those reported. 13  Thus we obtained sufficient rasfonin for further research.\n\nIn this study, we hypothesized that rasfonin affects the proliferation in K-ras mutant human pancreatic tumor cells by regulating the Ras-MAPK pathway. We first observed its effects on the K-ras mutation Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cell line in vitro, including cell proliferation, contact-independent growth, migration and invasion. We then investigated which signaling molecules were affected by rasfonin to identify its target. Finally, a mouse xenograft model originating from Panc-1 cells was set up and the therapeutic effects of rasfonin were evaluated in vivo.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on growth of human cancer cells in vitro.\n\nTo test the antitumor effects of rasfonin, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC-3 (wild-type K-ras) and Panc-1 (mutated K-ras). The assay involved exposing cells to 1-15muM rasfonin. Rasfonin had little inhibitory effect on BxPC-3 cells at 1 and 5muM (XREF_FIG). Even 10muM rasfonin inhibited BxPC-3 cell proliferation by only ~60% after 40h coculture (IC 50  =10muM). In contrast, 5muM rasfonin inhibited Panc-1 cell proliferation by approximately 30% after 24h incubation. FTS (50muM) inhibited proliferation a little more strongly than rasfonin during the first 24h. However, in the following 24h of incubation, rasfonin and FTS exhibited almost equivalent depressive effects on Panc-1 cell proliferation, and their maximum effect reached ~70%. The IC 50  of rasfonin on Panc-1 cell proliferation was 5.5muM. Rasfonin at higher concentrations (15muM in BxPC-3 cells and 10muM in Panc-1 cells) ultimately caused complete inhibition of proliferation in both pancreatic cancer cell lines. Similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated using the MTS assay (XREF_FIG). These results indicate that rasfonin shows relative selective-killing of ras-mutated cancer cells.\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on contact-independent growth of Panc-1 cells in vitro.\n\nNext, we examined the ability of rasfonin to inhibit the contact-independent growth of human pancreatic cancer cells. First, we investigated the colony-formation capacity of BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells. We found that BxPC-3 cells alone could not form visible colonies after 8 days of culture, so we only report data on the effect of rasfonin on contact-independent growth in Panc-1 cells. We seeded 1000 Panc-1 cells into the six-well plate with or without rasfonin. On day 8, the sizes and numbers of colonies were estimated. As illustrated in XREF_FIG, 74.1% of the seeded Panc-1 cells formed visible colonies in the absence of rasfonin. When rasfonin was added at 0.25-1muM, colony numbers and size were significantly reduced. When the rasfonin concentration reached 5muM, Panc-1 cells formed no visible colonies. These results suggest that rasfonin suppresses contact-independent growth of Panc-1 cells.\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on migration and invasion of Panc-1 cells in vitro.\n\nCancer cell migration is the movement of cells from one area to another, generally in response to chemical signals, and is important for cancer cell differentiation and metastasis. As in the colony-formation assay, we first investigated the migration and invasion capacities of BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells. We found that the migration and invasion signals of BxPC-3 cells were too weak for detection by the xCELLigence system. Thus, we only present the data concerning the effects of rasfonin on the migration and invasion of Panc-1 cells. As illustrated in XREF_FIG, cell migration peaked after ~11h of culture. FTS at 50muM caused a significant reduction (~75%) of the migratory activity of Panc-1 cells. Rasfonin concentrations from 1 to 30muM caused a dose-dependent reduction of the migratory activity of Panc-1 cells.\n\nCell invasion is intrusion into and destruction of adjacent tissues, particularly with respect to cancer cells. As illustrated in XREF_FIG, FTS (50muM) also inhibited Panc-1 cell invasion, but its efficacy was lower than that of 15muM rasfonin. Concentration-dependent suppression of cell invasion could also be observed from 1 to 15muM rasfonin.\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on Ras expression and activity in Panc-1 cells.\n\nThe above observations confirmed that rasfonin selectively destroys ras-mutated Panc-1 pancreatic cells. We therefore wondered whether it affects the Ras signaling pathway directly. Panc-1 cells were first treated with 1-10muM rasfonin and Ras protein expression was investigated by immunoblotting. It was abundantly clear that rasfonin, in contrast to FTS, had only a marginal effect on the expression of farnesylated and unfarnesylated Ras protein, so it had no effect on the modification of Ras protein required for anchoring to the plasmalemma after 12h of exposure (XREF_FIG).XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR\n\nIt has been well documented that Ras, in its active-GTP-bound state, binds to its downstream kinase c-Raf (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase) through a domain referred to as the Ras-Binding Domain (RBD). Because rasfonin did not change Ras protein expression, a pull-down assay using a commercial ELISA kit was used to study its effect on Ras-GTP in Panc-1 cells. This kit takes advantage of the fact that the RBD of Raf-1 binds preferentially to the activated form of Ras (Ras-GTP).XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR There was background activation of Ras in the Panc-1 cell and EGF stimulation had a modest effect on Ras-GTP levels. Consistent with previous studies, FTS remarkably reduced EGF-induced Ras activation at 50muM.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR Rasfonin also decreased EGF-induced Ras activation in a dose-dependent fashion, with a maximum effect approximate to that of FTS at 50muM (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on expression of downstream kinase of Ras in Panc-1 cells.\n\nThe key signaling pathway from activated Ras is the ERK/MAPK cascade, so we evaluated the phosphorylation of downstream protein kinases in Panc-1 cells by western blotting. Rasfonin clearly inhibited c-Raf, MEK and ERK phosphorylation, but had no significant effect on total MEK and ERK levels (XREF_FIG). Consistent with previous studies, FTS at 50muM caused a similar decrease in the expression of ERK-MAPK signaling pathway kinases. 22  These results indicated that rasfonin and FTS inhibit Ras protein activity and consequent downstream signaling protein activation.\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on Ras upstream kinase in Panc-1 cells.\n\nThe activity of the Ras family is controlled by the ratio of bound GTP to GDP, and because Ras proteins exchange GTP/GDP very slowly and possess a very low intrinsic GTPase activity, these processes are regulated by GEFs and GAPs. GEFs enhance the rate of GDP dissociation, whereas GAPs accelerate the intrinsic Ras-GTPase activity to promote Ras inactivation by several orders of magnitude. We examined the effects of rasfonin on GEF (Grb2/Sos1 complex) and GAP, respectively.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR Western blotting demonstrated that neither rasfonin nor FTS affected EGF-induced Grb2 or GAP protein expression, but apparently reduced the expression of Sos1 (XREF_FIG).\n\nNext, we assayed the GTP/GDP exchange reaction in the presence or absence of rasfonin using a radiolabeled [ 3 H]-GDP dissociation and binding assay. As expected, GEF promoted [ 3 H]-GDP dissociation from Ras in a Ras plus [ 3 H]-GDP preconditioning system. Preincubation of rasfonin with GEF did not enhance the effect on the dissociation of [ 3 H]-GDP from Ras (XREF_FIG). In respect of GAP activity, the competitive binding of [ 3 H]-GDP to Ras increased when GAP was added. However, preincubation of rasfonin with GAP did not affect the binding of [ 3 H]-GDP to Ras (XREF_FIG). The above observations suggest that the inhibition of Ras activity by rasfonin could be related, at least partially, to reduced Sos1 expression.\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on activities of other protein kinases in the EGFR signaling pathway.\n\nThe EGFR signaling pathway is most important in the spontaneous activation of K-ras. To clarify the selectivity of rasfonin, we chose 19 kinases in the EGFR signaling pathway and investigated their response to rasfonin. These kinases are EGFR, FGFR, PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta, Flt3, Met, FAK, c-RAF, MEK1, PI3Kinase, PKBalpha, PKBbeta, PKBgamma, IKKalpha, mTOR, p70S6K, JNK1alpha1, JNK2alpha2 and Ros. The [ 32 P] radiometric protein kinase assay results indicated that rasfonin at 5muM had only a marginal effect on all the protein kinases we chose except for p70s6k (XREF_TABLE). These data suggest that the extent of influence of rasfonin is relatively limited.\n\n\n\nEffects of rasfonin on growth of K-ras mutant Panc-1 cell xenograft tumors.\n\nAfter showing that rasfonin inhibits cell growth and transformation in vitro, we were interested in assessing its effect in vivo. Mice were treated with 7.5, 15 or 30mg/kg rasfonin every 2 days for 3 consecutive weeks. Control mice were treated with either vehicle (negative control group) or FTS (positive control group). Treatment was started when the tumor xenograft reached ~200mm 3 , and the effects of compounds on tumor growth are summarized in XREF_FIG. Although the average tumor size increased from 244 to 979mm 3  in the control group (a fourfold increase), the average tumor size in the rasfonin-treated group increased from 193mm 3  to 319mm 3 , representing a relatively modest (T/C=33%) but statistically significant reduction in tumor growth (67% tumor growth reduction; P=0.019). FTS was administered at doses and schedules reported to give optimal antitumor efficacy in some pancreatic tumor models, 23  but it demonstrated no significant antitumor efficacy in the Panc-1 xenograft model: the %T/C for that group, calculated on day 20, was 52%, representing a 48% reduction in tumor growth (P=0.337). At the end of the experiment, the mice were killed and the xenograft tumors were extirpated and weighed. The average tumor weight in the rasfonin-treated group (30mg/kg) was less than half of that in the control group (P<0.05; XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nRasfonin is a structurally novel 2-pyrone derivative isolated from the fermented mycelium of Talaromyces species 3656-A1(13). Previous reports have revealed that rasfonin selectively induces apoptosis in ras-dependent cells and could represent a unique class of cancer chemotherapeutics useful for treating ras-mutant tumors. 14  In this study we focused on the effects of rasfonin on pancreatic cancer because 90% pancreatic cancers exhibit K-ras mutations. We found that rasfonin suppressed proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion of K-ras mutant Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells and caused mild growth suppression of wild-type K-ras BxPC-3. We extended our in vitro studies to an in vivo Panc-1 xenograft tumor model on CD1 nude mice. Intraperitoneal rasfonin administration resulted in moderate but statistically significant antitumor activity with a 67% overall reduction of tumor growth compared with the vehicle control group. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the unambiguous effect of rasfonin on K-ras mutant pancreatic cells and xenograft tumor mice.\n\nIn both our in vitro and in vivo studies, Salirasib (S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, FTS) served as a positive control to evaluate the effects of rasfonin. FTS is a low molecular weight synthetic compound and a potent Ras inhibitor. 20  It mimics the carboxy terminal of farnesylcysteine carboxymethyl ester, which is common to all Ras proteins and forms part of the recognition unit for anchorage, so it displaces active Ras protein from the cell membrane.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR FTS readily enters cells and specifically disrupts the association of active forms of Ras proteins with the inner surface of the membrane; this disturbance contributes to the inhibition of cell transformation and tumor growth.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR We chose FTS as a positive control because of its unique mechanism of action. Several previous studies have demonstrated that FTS decreases the cellular Ras protein level and inhibits Ras activation. 28  Consistent with these studies, our results indicated that FTS reduced Ras protein expression robustly. In contrast, rasfonin did not affect Ras protein levels, though it suppressed Ras activation as FTS does. These data implied that rasfonin differs from FTS in mechanism of action.\n\nNormal Ras proteins are continuously cycling between inactive (Ras-GDP) and active (Ras-GTP) conformations. Molecular activation triggered by different extracellular stimuli increases the intracellular Ras-GTP level and elicits a conformational change, enabling these GTPases to interact with downstream effector proteins. The kinetics of cellular Ras activation is modulated through different negative and positive regulators. The negative regulators include GTPase-activating proteins (Ras-GAPs), which enhance the intrinsic Ras-GTPase activity and elicit rapid hydrolysis of bound GTP. The positive regulators correspond to the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Ras-GEFs) that stimulate release of bound GDP in exchange for GTP, so the active Ras-GTP complex accumulates in response to upstream stimuli. 29  Overactive Ras can put the growth signaling pathway in an 'always on' state, even in the absence of incoming signals. In our study, to ascertain whether the restraint of proliferation of K-ras-mutated pancreatic cells could be, in part, due to a loss of Ras activation, a pull-down assay was used to study the effect of rasfonin on Ras-GTP in Panc-1 cells. The results indicated that Ras is already activated in the Panc-1 cell line and EGF stimulation had an evident effect on Ras-GTP levels. Rasfonin treatment reduced EGF-induced Ras activation in a dose-dependent fashion but did not affect total Ras protein expression. These data confirmed previous studies demonstrating that rasfonin affects the Ras signaling pathway. To explore the potential mechanism of rasfonin action further, Ras-GAP and Ras-GEF activities were detected through [ 3 H]-GDP binding and dissociation. Interestingly, rasfonin affected neither Ras-GAP nor Ras-GEF activity, nor did it affect the protein expression of Ras-GAP or Grb2 (one ingredient of Ras-GEF). Indeed, among all the upstream Ras signaling molecules we measured, it only reduced the expression of Son of sevenless 1 (Sos1).\n\nSos1 and Sos2 belong to the Sos family. Mammalian Sos1 and Sos2 proteins have approximately 70% overall homology, are ubiquitously expressed and function by coupling signals originating from cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to downstream, Ras-dependent mitogenic signaling pathways. Sos1 is a dual GEF for Ras and interacts with the adaptor protein Grb2.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR The Grb2-Sos1 complex is recruited to phosphotyrosine residues of ligand-activated RTKs through the SH2 domain of Grb2. RTK activation thus results in the translocation of Sos1 to the plasma membrane, where Ras is present, thereby facilitating Sos1-mediated Ras activation. 33  Although aberrant expression of many downstream and upstream components of the Ras/ERK pathway is clearly associated with carcinogenesis, very few reports suggest a possible role for Sos genes in human proliferative pathologies.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR Indeed, screening studies indicate that Sos1 mutations are uncommon in human tumors. On the other hand, recent reports have described the enhanced expression of Sos1 in prostate cancer epithelial cells of African-American men. Depletion of Sos1 in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells results in decreased capacities for cell proliferation, migration and invasion, so Sos1 is considered a promising cancer therapy target. 35  There has been no report to date concerning the effect of FTS on Sos1. However, we found that FTS indubitably reduced EGF-induced Sos1 expression. Interestingly, rasfonin decreased Sos1 expression to the same extent. The underlying mechanism is still unknown and needs further investigation. In addition, we presume that apart from the Sos1 (GEF)-Ras cascade, the influence of rasfonin could be restricted because it had only marginal effects on the many protein kinases involved in the EGFR signaling pathway, except for p70S6k.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that the novel 2-pyrone derivative rasfonin is a promising lead compound for treating K-ras mutation pancreatic cancer.
