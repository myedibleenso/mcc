To uncover these roles, we screened a cDNA library and isolated H-Ras-binding proteins that also influence Ras functions. Many isolated proteins regulate trafficking involving endosomes; CHMP6/VPS20 and VPS4A, which interact with ESCRT-III, were chosen for further study. We showed that the binding is direct and occurs in endosomes. Furthermore, the binding is most efficient when H-Ras has a functional effector-binding-loop and is GTP-bound and ubiquitylated. CHMP6 and VPS4A also bound N-Ras, but not K-Ras. Repressing CHMP6 and VPS4A blocked Ras-induced transformation, which correlated with inefficient Ras localization to the PM as measured by cell fractionation and photobleaching. Moreover, silencing CHMP6 and VPS4A also blocked EGFR recycling. These data suggest that Ras interacts with key ESCRT-III components to promote recycling of itself and EGFR back to the PM to create a positive feedback loop to enhance growth factor signaling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThere are three RAS genes in humans, H-, N-, and K-RAS, and the latter encodes two proteins, K-Ras-4A and K-Ras-4B. These Ras proteins, when GTP-bound, signal through many effectors to control a wide range of functions including tumorigenesis (XREF_BIBR). The importance of Ras localization to the plasma membrane (PM) is well established as PM is where Ras proteins associate with receptors, such as EGFR, to mediate growth factor signaling. However, increasing evidence suggests that Ras proteins can also signal from many cytoplasmic membrane compartments, and some of these cytoplasmic activities are required for cell transformation (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).\n\nAmong these cytoplasmic compartments on which Ras is known to signal, the roles of endosomes are particularly complex and intriguing. RIN1 is a Ras effector (XREF_BIBR) and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5, which controls membrane docking and fusion during the early stage of endocytosis (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). One of the Rab5 effectors is RABGEF1/Rabex-5, which functions as a ubiquitin ligase for H- and N-Ras to facilitate their endosome association (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). This pathway appears to attenuate Ras signaling, as measured by MEK/Erk activation, presumably by internalizing Ras, as well as growth factor receptors such as EGFR (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, Ras and EGFR on endosomes appear to be active -- that is, Ras proteins remain GTP-bound, while EGFR remains phosphorylated (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). These observations raise the important question as to whether endosomal Ras pathways continue to signal or whether the observed activation of its components is only temporary without substantial biological significance. In short, the roles of endosomes in Ras signaling are very complex and poorly understood.\n\nIn this study, we attempted to define Ras cytoplasmic functions by screening for Ras-binding proteins that selectively interact with Ras in the cytoplasm. We thus identified 26 proteins that can bind and alter Ras activities. Intriguingly, many of the isolated Ras-binding proteins function at endosomes, two of which, CHMP6/VPS20 and VPS4A, were analyzed in detail. Our results support a model whereby CHMP6 and VPS4A are novel Ras effectors needed for transformation. Ras can interact with CHMP6 and VPS4A to control recycling of itself, as well as EGFR, back to the PM, thus generating a positive feedback loop to enhance Ras signaling.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nScreen human Ras-interacting proteins in live mammalian cells using BiFC.\n\nTo identify Ras-interacting proteins in live human cells, we screened a human cDNA library (hORFeome v1.1) containing 8,100 full-length clones (XREF_BIBR), using the Biomolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) system (XREF_BIBR). This system has been used previously to detect the binding between constitutively active H-Ras (e.g., H-Ras(12V) or H-Ras(61L)) fused to a N-terminus fragment of YFP (Yn) and many Ras effectors, such as Raf, Cdc42, or RIN1, fused to a C-terminus fragment of YFP (Yc, (XREF_BIBR)). The Yc-tagged cDNAs were transfected into HT1080 cells stably expressing Yn-H-Ras(12V), and the cells were sorted by FACS (see Materials and Methods). The Ras binding domain in Raf, RafRBD, was fused to Yc as the positive control (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY), while the Yc alone was analyzed as the negative control. Isolated cDNAs were further tested against Yn-GST, as well as Yn-H-Ras E(12V), in which the effector-binding loop has been mutated. We thus identified 64 proteins that bind H-Ras(12V), but not the GST control. Some of them also bind H-Ras E(12V) with substantially reduced affinity (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). One of the identified proteins is A-Raf, which validates the effectiveness of the screen to identify Ras effectors.\n\nTo determine whether the isolated proteins also control Ras functions, we overexpressed all of them, except A-Raf, in NIH3T3 cells transformed by constitutively active H-Ras(61L) and then measured colony formation in soft-agar. These proteins were also tested for the ability to alter Ras-induced gene transcription by an Elk-1-mediated luciferase reporter assay, which is controlled by the Raf-MAP kinase pathway. Only 26 proteins were able to inhibit both Ras-related activities (XREF_TABLE). Intriguingly, only one protein, LEPROTL1, appears to enhance a Ras-induced activity when overexpressed in the gene expression assay. It is possible that most of these isolated genes act as dominant-negatives when overexpressed (see below).\n\n\n\nValidate the binding between Ras and isolated proteins by BiFC fluorescent microscopy.\n\nNine out of the 26 isolated proteins are known to associate with cellular membrane and/or to regulate protein transportation, suggesting that as a group this screen has identified proteins that may regulate Ras trafficking. In particular, two of them, CHMP6/VPS20 and VPS4A, are well known to interact with ESCRT-III (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III) components to control endosomal protein sorting (XREF_BIBR). Endosome trafficking has been shown to impact Ras signaling as discussed above; thus, CHMP6 and VPS4A were chosen for detailed analyses.\n\nWe determined where in the cells these two proteins can interact with Ras and whether they form a stable complex. HT1080 cells expressing both Yn-tagged H-Ras(12V) and Yc-tagged either CHMP6 or VPS4A were examined by confocal microscopy (XREF_FIG). In accordance with the fact that VPS4A and CHMP6 are known to function in endosomes, the reconstituted YFP signals were found only in the cytoplasm, but not at the PM, and co-localized in particular with those of CFP-tagged early endosome marker Rab5A, as well as with the late endosome/MVB (multivesicular bodies) marker Rab7A, but not with recycling endosome marker Rab11A and Golgi marker GalT. These results suggest that these proteins mostly interact in early and late endosomes/MVBs, but not in recycling endosome, Golgi, or PM.\n\n\n\nH-Ras binding to CHMP6 and VPS4A is direct and dependent on GTP and ubiquitylation.\n\nNext, we analyzed whether the binding between Ras and CHMP6 and VPS4A was GTP-dependent by performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments using ectopically expressed proteins. As shown in XREF_FIG, H-Ras(61L), which is expected to be preferentially GTP-bound, efficiently co-immunoprecipitated CHMP6 and VPS4A, while the wild type H-Ras could barely do so; conversely, when CHMP6 was immunoprecipitated, H-Ras(61L) was readily co-immunoprecipitated, while wild type H-Ras was not. Similar results were obtained with VPS4A. Furthermore, protein cargos that are sorted and/or transported in endosomes (and by the ESCRT-III complex, in particular) are frequently ubiquitylated. H-Ras has been shown to be ubiquitylated; therefore, we investigated whether ubiquitylation of H-Ras is critical for binding to these two proteins. To this end, we first repeated the co-immuoprecipitation experiments using H-Ras-8RK and H-Ras(12V)-8RK, in which all five solvent-exposed lysines, along with the three lysines located in the hyper variable region, were mutated to arginine to block ubiquitylation (XREF_BIBR). When either H-Ras was immunoprecipitated, no detectable CHMP6 could be seen and vice versa (XREF_FIG). Furthermore, when VPS4A was immunoprecipitated, very little H-Ras(12V)-8RK or H-Ras-8RK could be co-immunoprecipiated, as compared to a similar experiment when H-Ras(12V) or H-Ras was examined. Likewise when the reverse immunoprecipitation was performed, while considerably more H-Ras-8RK and H-Ras(12V)-8RK than the normal H-Ras(12V) were immunoprecipitated, very little VPS4A was detected.\n\nTo more directly show that the binding is direct and requires H-Ras to be ubiquitylated in mammalian cells, we performed FRET analysis using CFP-tagged Ras proteins and YFP-tagged VPS4A. VPS4A was chosen because it binds Ras more strongly (XREF_FIG), and its repression blocks Ras-induced transformation more efficiently (see below). Besides H-Ras(61L) and H-Ras(12V)-8RK, we also examined Ub-H-Ras, which is a fusion protein between wild type H-Ras and an ubiquitin moiety (XREF_BIBR). As shown in XREF_FIG, FRET signals were readily detected when YFP-VPS4A was co-expressed with CFP-H-Ras(61L), but not with CFP-H-Ras(12V)-8RK. Furthermore, despite the fact that Ub-H-Ras is not constitutively GTP-bound, it still bound VPS4A more strongly than did H-Ras(61L).\n\n\n\nEndogenous Ras isoform-specific binding to VPS4A and CHMP6.\n\nTo determine whether different endogenous Ras isoforms bind CHMP6 and VPS4A with different efficiencies, we immunoprecipitated Ras proteins using isoform-specific antibodies from DCIS.COM, HT1080, and CAPAN-1 cells, which are known to endogenously express oncogenic H-RAS, N-RAS, and K-RAS, respectively. XREF_FIG showed that only H-Ras and N-Ras, but not K-Ras, can be co-immunoprecipitated with CHMP6 or VPS4A. These data suggest that efficient binding of CHMP6 and VPS4A to Ras proteins requires the latter to be ubiquitylated and GTP-bound and that N- and H-Ras proteins may bind them more efficiently than K-Ras does.\n\n\n\nProper CHMP6 and VPS4A levels are important for H-Ras-induced cell transformation.\n\nTo further elucidate how CHMP6 and VPS4A regulate Ras functions, we knocked down CHMP6 and VPS4A by shRNAs in H-Ras(61L)-transformed NIH3T3 cells, and found that the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar was greatly reduced, which was rescued by cDNAs that are refractory to the shRNAs (XREF_FIG). These shRNAs did not have any adverse effects on overall H-Ras levels or cell growth under normal conditions (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). We conducted two experiments to determine whether CHMP6 and VPS4A influence H-Ras-induced transformation with selectivity. In the first, we induced cell transformation by the SV40 T-antigen, and found that silencing either molecule had also no detectable effect on focus formation (XREF_FIG). In the second, we silenced CHMP6 or VPS4A in HT-1080 and CAPAN-1 cells, which carry oncogenic N- and K-RAS, respectively, and found that colony formation in soft agar was only inhibited in the former cells (XREF_FIG). These data suggest that CHMP6 and VPS4A are selectively required for H-Ras and N-Ras to transform cells.\n\nDuring the initial phase of the screen, overexpressing Yc-tagged CHMP6 and VPS4A also blocked Ras activities (XREF_TABLE). GFP-tagged ESCRT-III components, when overexpressed, have been reported to act in a dominant negative fashion (XREF_BIBR), possibly due to the bulky GFP tag. To examine whether it is the bulk of tag that was responsible for blocking Ras activities in our study, we replaced the Yc with FLAG, and the resulting proteins still inhibited soft agar colony formation (XREF_FIG). Like their down-regulation, overexpressing these two molecules did not affect H-Ras(61L) levels or cell proliferation under normal conditions (data not shown). We conclude from these studies that proper levels of CHMP6 and VPS4A are critical for oncogenic Ras to induce cell transformation.\n\n\n\nCHMP6 and VPS4A control Ras localization to the plasma membrane.\n\nSince both VPS4A and CHMP6 are involved in endosomal protein sorting and bind Ras in endosomes, we investigated the possibility that they are important for proper Ras localization to various membrane compartments in the cell. We thus examined the distribution of H-Ras in the CHMP6 or VPS4A-silenced cells by sucrose gradient fractionation. H-Ras can be found in both the lighter fractions (marked by caveolin-1, fractions 3-6) containing lipid rafts as well as the heavier fractions (marked by Na + /K +  ATPase, fractions 11-13) containing bulk PM (XREF_FIG). When H-Ras is GTP-bound, it shifts from the lighter to the heavier fractions (XREF_BIBR). Our data show that when VPS4A levels were repressed, the levels of wild-type and oncogenic H-Ras proteins in the heavier fractions were dramatically reduced. The levels of H-Ras proteins in heavier fractions of CHMP6 knocked-down cells were also significantly decreased (wild-type H-Ras, 20%; oncogenic H-Ras, 26%). These data support the possibility that VPS4A and CHMP6 are required for H-Ras to properly localize to bulk PM.\n\nTo further decipher how CHMP6 and VPS4A impact trafficking of H-Ras to the PM, we performed photobleaching experiments. The aforementioned shRNA vectors contain GFP, which was used to mark cells whose CHMP6 or VPS4A levels were repressed (XREF_FIG). To choose another fluorescent tag for photobleaching, we expressed in these cells an H-Ras tagged with a green-to-red photoactivatable fluorescent protein Dendra2. In our lab, the Dendra2 can be most efficiently photoconverted to a red fluorescent protein by UV (see Materials and methods), and we did not detect any difference in photoconversion efficiency in the control vs. knock down cells. We then photobleached the photoconverted red H-Ras at the PM by all lasers and measured its fluorescence recovery by scanning the whole field at 543 nm, which is not expected to induce additional photoconversion. Our data showed that when either CHMP6 or VPS4A was silenced, substantial delay in recovery was seen at the PM (XREF_FIG). We note that as signal at the PM increased/recovered over time, there was a concurrent decrease of fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm in the same photobleached cells, as one would expect as Dendra2 tagged H-Ras moved from the cytoplasm to the PM. Further, when a neighboring unbleached cell was examined as control, we detected a slight decrease of fluorescence over time, characteristic of spontaneous photobleaching. These observations rule out the possibility that the method used for detecting photoconverted Dendra2 induced new photoconversion. In summary, together with the biochemical data in XREF_FIG, we conclude that CHMP6 and VPS4A play critical roles in the efficient transport of H-Ras to the PM.\n\n\n\nRas is also necessary for efficient EGFR recycling.\n\nCHMP6 and VPS4A are components of the ESCRT-III pathway, whose best known function is to sort proteins in endosomes. Intriguingly, it has been shown recently that this complex also controls recycling of EGFR back to the PM (XREF_BIBR). We confirmed this in HT1080 cells -- EGFR appears to internalize 15 min after EGF addition, and within 30 min, a large portion of the internalized EGFRs was recycled back to the PM to reach equilibrium (XREF_FIG and (XREF_BIBR)). In contrast, in CHMP6 or VPS4A-silenced cells, there was no detectable EGFR at the PM 30 min after EGF addition, indicating that its recycling was inhibited. To determine whether Ras can also control EGFR recycling, we knocked down endogenous N-Ras expression in these cells, and at 30 min after adding EGF, measured fluorescence levels at the PM vs. that in the whole cell (XREF_FIG). Our data show that the proportion of labeled EGFR at the PM in N-RAS-silenced cells was reduced by 3-fold compared to that in control cells. By contrast, knocking down K-RAS in MDA-MB-231 cells, which express oncogenic K-RAS, did not affect EGFR recycling (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). These data indicate that N-Ras, but not K-Ras, can act like components of the ESCRT-III complex to play a role in EGFR recycling.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nOur screen identified many novel Ras-binding proteins that are known to regulate trafficking and membrane dynamics with a slight enrichment in proteins that function in endosomes. In particular, both VPS4A and CHMP6 are known to interact with ESCRT-III. Our data show that inactivating either of them blocks Ras-induced transformation, as well as localization of Ras and EGFR to the PM. Since the binding to these two proteins is enhanced when Ras is GTP-bound, it seems likely that the Ras-VPS4A/CHMP6 interaction generates a positive-feedback loop to enhance Ras signaling by replenishing important components in the Ras pathway, such as Ras itself and EGFR, on the PM for sustained and prolonged signaling. This conclusion agrees with several studies that also show that Ras localization to endosomes can positively impact Ras-induced transformation. For example, Roy et al. have shown that blocking endocytosis inhibits transformation induced by both H- and N-Ras (XREF_BIBR), and we have shown that H- and N-Ras proteins can act via Cdc42 in endosomes to transform cells (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Finally, as discussed earlier, H-Ras internalization by RIN1 appears to attenuate Ras signaling, and internalized K-Ras can be sent to lysosomes for degradation (XREF_BIBR). Our study suggests that there is an alternative fate for endosomal Ras proteins -- they can interact with the ESCRT-III, which act as a sorting station, to recycle back to the PM to enhance Ras-induced activities. A key question for the future is to decipher how the decision is made for a given Ras protein in the endosome to remain internalized and be later degraded or to be sent back to the PM.\n\nRas localization to endosomes is enhanced by ubiquitylation, and in an earlier study using CHOK1 cells, only H- and N-Ras, but not K-Ras-4B, were found to be ubiquitylated (XREF_BIBR). This observation agrees with the fact that high levels of H- and N-Ras are frequently found in cytoplasm, but K-Ras-4B is often found exclusively on the PM. In a more recent study, K-Ras-4B was found to be ubiquitylated in HEK293 cells (XREF_BIBR). This new finding suggests that ubiquitylation of H- and N-Ras are more common in a wide range of cells, while ubiquitylation of K-Ras-4B may be more cell-type specific. This difference in how various Ras proteins become ubiquitylated may affect how Ras proteins interact with proteins on endosomes. In the present study, even though we also used HEK293 cells, neither CHMP6 nor VPS4A co-immunoprecipitated proteins that could be detected by the pan-reactive Ras antibody. It is likely that there was only a small fraction of endogenous K-Ras (or H- and N-Ras) that is GTP-bound and/or ubiquitylated. Moreover, using human cancer cell lines that carry different oncogenic Ras proteins, we showed that only H- and N-Ras can bind VPS4A and CHMP6. Based on these results, we conclude that H- and N-Ras, but not K-Ras, can readily bind VPS4A and CHMP6 because H- and N-Ras are more efficiently ubiquitylated than K-Ras in the cell lines we examined.\n\nOur biochemical and microscopy data strongly suggest that the binding between H-Ras and ESCRT-III is direct and requires the former to be ubiquitylated. If Ras ubiquitylation is critical for recycling components of the Ras pathway back to the PM, it may seem counterintuitive at first glance that ectopically expressed H-Ras(12V)-8RK has been shown to still efficiently activate Raf (XREF_BIBR). Further, in a later follow up study, we found that H-Ras(12V)-8RK can efficiently transform cells (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). We suggest that these observations are consistent with the fact that H-Ras(12V)-8RK, which has a fully functional effector-binding domain, is not efficiently internalized so it accumulates at high levels at the PM, a key compartment on which it interacts with Raf. Moreover, when a protein is transiently ectopically expressed, it is frequently overexpressed. Thus, besides the PM pool of Raf, H-Ras(12V)-8RK may accumulate at high enough levels in many other cell compartments to activate Raf, as well as additional Ras effectors.\n\nWhile the PM has long been thought to be the key compartment from which Ras signals to mediate tumor formation, Ras can also signal from many cytoplasmic compartments. H-Ras, when targeted to ER and Golgi, can still transform cells efficiently (XREF_BIBR). The important roles of Golgi and ER in Ras-induced transformation are further underscored by the fact that our screen identified many proteins (e.g. RTN3 (XREF_BIBR)) that mediate intracellular trafficking involving these two compartments. We note that our screen using the BiFC technology has at least two advantages that are not found with a more conventional approach based on co-immunoprecipitation to allow for efficient identification of new Ras-binding proteins. First, this method can detect transient and weak protein-protein interactions because once a protein complex is formed, it is secured by not only the binding between the two proteins of interest, but also by the strong hydrogen bonds formed between the N-and C-terminal regions of YFP (XREF_BIBR). Second, our screen was not influenced by abundance of proteins in the cell at steady state since each gene in the ORFeome cDNA library is equally represented.
