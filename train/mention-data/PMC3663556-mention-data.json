After binding GTP, Ras undergoes a conformational change and activates downstream signaling partners by recruiting them to distinct cellular membrane locations. Thus, activation through Ras occurs by interaction with effector Ras-binding domains (RBDs), 2  such as that found in Raf and the catalytic subunit p110 of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (XREF_BIBR). Ras activity is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins that render the protein GDP-bound and thus inactive and guanosine exchange factors that facilitate the GDP/GTP exchange, which activates Ras.\n\nDespite a substantially differing hypervariable region at the C terminus, all three isoforms (H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras) share high sequence homology. Principally, Ras isoforms can interact with the same down-stream effectors, but isoform-specific signaling events are regulated by the expression profile and localization to discrete cellular membranes and microdomains (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). Successful plasma membrane (PM) localization of H-Ras requires at least two different types of post-translational modifications at the C terminus. Farnesylation of cysteine 186, a modification of the CAAX motif and common to all isoforms, weakly tethers Ras to the endoplasmic reticulum. There, the AAX is proteolytically cleaved, and the terminal farnesylated Cys-186 is methylated. In H-Ras, this weak membrane interaction is strengthened by palmitoylation of Cys-181 and Cys-184 in the hypervariable region, resulting in a stable PM localization (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR).\n\nAt the PM, the thioester bond is hydrolyzed, relocalizing H-Ras to endomembranes, including the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). The molecular mechanism of H-Ras depalmitoylation, the key enzymes involved, and their regulation are still under investigation (XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR). Despite the long held belief that H-Ras signals exclusively from the PM and PM-derived endosomes (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR), constitutively active H-Ras may mediate GTPase signaling at endomembranes, especially the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, and two recent publications have demonstrated that this phenomenon occurs with endogenous H-Ras in cell lines (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). To date, functional studies in primary cells have not been performed, and it is unknown whether or not endomembrane H-Ras is involved in physiological endothelial cell (EC) signaling.\n\nFor angiogenesis in the adult, the importance of H-Ras signaling is well recognized (XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR). VEGF is a central modulator of angiogenesis in ECs, and its signaling via H-Ras modulates EC function. However, the molecular mechanism through which the VEGF receptor transmits the signal to this isoform remains elusive. VEGF stimulation increases Grb2 association with the receptor (XREF_BIBR) and increases Ras GTP loading. However, in ECs, VEGF-induced Raf/MEK/ERK activation is mainly mediated by PKC (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). Nevertheless, GTP-bound H-Ras associates with various downstream effectors important for angiogenesis, including Raf1 and PI3K, which in turn mediate proliferative, migratory, and survival signaling.\n\nUsing thiol labeling strategies, we found that 31% of H-Ras was palmitoylated in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), leaving the function of the large majority of H-Ras in the cell unexplained. In this study, we demonstrate an essential role of endomembrane H-Ras in EC signaling. By using a non-constitutively active palmitoylation-deficient H-Ras mutant that solely localizes to endomembranes, we found that activation of H-Ras at endomembranes is sufficient for VEGF-mediated signaling that controls the angiogenic response via PI3K, Akt, and eNOS phosphorylation, leading to EC migration.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nVEGF-induced EC Migration Is H-Ras-dependent.\n\nH-Ras is the major isoform in HAECs and in microvascular ECs (murine lung and cardiac ECs), as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR of mRNA expression levels (XREF_FIGA). The role of H-Ras in EC migration was assessed by siRNA targeting of endogenous H-Ras in HAECs. The siRNA specificity toward H-Ras is shown in XREF_FIGB. Although vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) (50 ng/ml) led to EC cell migration, H-Ras knockdown abolished the promigratory response to VEGF (XREF_FIGA).\n\nTo ensure that the proangiogenic phenotype is specifically mediated by H-Ras, we depleted HAECs of N-Ras (XREF_FIGB and XREF_FIGB) and measured EC migration in response to VEGF (XREF_FIGB). Although N-Ras comprises about 25% of total Ras mRNA in HAECs (XREF_FIGA), knockdown of this isoform did not alter the migratory response to VEGF, as demonstrated in XREF_FIGB.\n\nActivated H-Ras binds directly to the RBD of PI3K and triggers the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which controls Akt activity. Akt via specific phosphorylation of eNOS at position Ser-1177 activates the enzyme and enhances  * NO production (XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR). Released  * NO increases cyclic GMP and activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity (PKG), which increases phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239 (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). In accordance with the migration data, less Akt (Ser-473), eNOS (Ser-1177), and VASP (Ser-239) phosphorylation (XREF_FIG, C and D) was observed after knockdown of endogenous H-Ras than in control cells after VEGF stimulation, explaining the molecular mechanism for the loss of migratory response. However, VEGF-mediated activation of ERK 1/2 was unaltered after knockdown of the small GTPase, indicating that utilization of siRNA against H-Ras does not influence VEGF receptor behavior per se. The levels of total protein of Akt, eNOS, VASP, and ERK 1/2 were not affected by siRNA against H-Ras (XREF_FIGC).\n\nConsistent with the lack of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177, eNOS activity in H-Ras-depleted cells, measured by conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline, was attenuated in response to VEGF compared with cells treated with control siRNA (XREF_FIGD). These data are consistent with a central role of H-Ras in proangiogenic VEGF signaling of HAECs.\n\n\n\nThe Majority of H-Ras Is Not Palmitoylated and Resides at Endomembranes.\n\nThioester-linked palmitoylation of cysteines 181 and 184 tethers H-Ras to the PM, whereas unmodified H-Ras accumulates at endomembranes, preferentially at the Golgi, where palmitoyl acyltansferases reside. The hydroxylamine (HA)-dependent biotin switch, a reverse labeling technique for palmitoylated cysteines (see XREF_FIGA), was used to determine the ratio of endogenous palmitoylated versus total H-Ras in HAECs. Reducing all reversibly oxidized cysteines with DTT and hydrolyzing the thioester bonds with HA, all 5 cysteines on H-Ras were labeled (XREF_FIGB, lane 1). Using HA alone, only palmitoylated cysteines were selectively labeled (XREF_FIGB, lane 2). Pull-down of the labeled protein with streptavidin beads followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against H-Ras showed that only 31% of total endogenous H-Ras in HAECs was palmitoylated (XREF_FIG, B and C).\n\nBecause the majority of H-Ras in ECs is not palmitoylated, it is expected to localize exclusively to endomembranes (XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR). Accordingly, HAECs moderately overexpressing H-Ras WT showed both PM and endomembrane localization (XREF_FIGA, right). Mutation of both palmitoylation sites C181S and C184S (H-Ras PalM), as shown previously in NIH3T3 (XREF_BIBR) and MDCK cell lines (XREF_BIBR), causes localization of the mutant solely to endomembranes in HAECs (XREF_FIGA, left). VEGF-mediated activation of eNOS (phosphorylation at Ser-1177 after 30 min) primarily occurred in the perinuclear region, as shown in XREF_FIG, B and C, also indicating endomembrane signaling of eNOS. Thus, the H-Ras PalM mutant serves as a model to study H-Ras function at this subcellular compartment because other proteins necessary in angiogenic signaling, including eNOS, show similar subcellular localization and activation.\n\n\n\nEndomembrane-delimited H-Ras Is Sufficient to Mediate VEGF-induced Endothelial Cell Migration.\n\nAs demonstrated in XREF_FIGA, knockdown of endogenous H-Ras inhibits EC migration and signaling caused by VEGF, confirming that H-Ras is required for proangiogenic signaling. Reconstitution of H-Ras-depleted HAECs with the H-Ras PalM mutant restored the migratory phenotype (XREF_FIGA). In addition, restoration of the proangiogenic signaling cascade PI3K/Akt/eNOS/VASP also occurred by overexpressing H-Ras PalM (XREF_FIG, B and C), indicating that H-Ras at the endomembrane can fully reconstitute proangiogenic signaling by VEGF for induced  * NO production and EC migration.\n\n\n\nEndomembrane H-Ras Is Sufficient for VEGF-induced Akt and eNOS Phosphorylation and  * NO Production.\n\nAs shown in XREF_FIG, reconstitution of H-Ras-depleted HAECs with the endomembrane-localized H-Ras PalM, restored Akt Ser-473 and eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation in response to VEGF. Consistent with eNOS activation, the enhanced phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239 indicates an increase in PKG caused by eNOS-derived  * NO (XREF_FIG, C and D). Although overexpression of adenoviral H-Ras WT results in increased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, the main portion of VEGF-mediated activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is mediated by PKC in EC (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). Conversely, we found that blocking PKC with Go6983 in HAECs had no effect on VEGF-mediated Akt and eNOS phosphorylation (data not shown). In contrast, inhibition of PI3K with the specific inhibitor LY 294002 prevented VEGF-induced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation as well as EC migration mediated by not only WT but also H-Ras PalM (XREF_FIG, A and C), demonstrating the importance of PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling downstream of endomembrane H-Ras. In addition, treatment of cells with the eNOS inhibitor l-NAME prevented VEGF-induced migration in HAECs depleted of H-Ras and reconstituted with either H-Ras WT or PalM (XREF_FIGB), demonstrating that endomembrane H-Ras is sufficient to explain VEGF-induced  * NO-mediated EC migration.\n\n\n\nVEGF Activates Endomembrane-delimited H-Ras.\n\nAs demonstrated in XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG, the palmitoylation-deficient mutant H-Ras PalM is fully capable of mediating VEGF-induced signaling via PI3K/Akt/eNOS and EC migration. However, only GTP-bound H-Ras interacts with its downstream effectors mediating signaling. To support our hypothesis, we measured the ratio of GTP-bound H-Ras to total H-Ras in HAECs stimulated with VEGF over a time course. HAECs depleted of endogenous H-Ras and reconstituted with H-Ras PalM show an increase in endomembrane H-Ras/GTP starting at 30 min with activity persisting over a time period of 2 h. Unlike EGF, which causes H-Ras activation in HEK 293T and HeLa cells within seconds to 5 min (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR), VEGF causes a late and sustained activation of endomembrane H-Ras in endothelial cells, mirroring Akt and eNOS phosphorylation/activity (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nHere we define a novel role for endomembrane H-Ras in VEGF-induced EC migration. Utilizing a knockdown/reconstitution approach, we show that palmitoylation-deficient H-Ras localized at the endomembranes is preferentially activated by VEGF and fully capable of mediating proangiogenic signaling via PI3K-dependent phosphorylation and activation of Akt and eNOS, enabling EC migration.\n\nRas isoforms are essential components of growth factor signaling. Although expressed ubiquitously, mRNA levels of the various isoforms appear to be regulated both spatially and temporally. K-Ras knock-out animals are embryonic lethal, whereas N-Ras- and H-Ras-deficient mice show no obvious developmental abnormality (XREF_BIBR). However, the importance of H-Ras in post-natal EC angiogenic signaling is undeniable, given its role in differentiating vascular progenitors into ECs stimulated by VEGF (XREF_BIBR) and development of capillary-like structures (XREF_BIBR). Finally, our results show clearly the essential role of H-Ras in EC migration. Its unique function is further supported, in that depletion of N-Ras shows no impairment of EC migration in response to VEGF (XREF_FIGB). The Ras isoform expression profiles of ECs (XREF_FIGA) suggest that our model of endomembrane H-Ras signaling in HAECs may also translate into microvascular ECs. HUVECs, however, represent fetal ECs, which express N-Ras as the predominant isoform and exhibit comparably higher levels of K-Ras than aortic and microvascular ECs (XREF_FIGA), suggesting differences in Ras signaling.\n\nSerban et al. (XREF_BIBR) characterized the role of the two main downstream H-Ras effectors, utilizing constitutively active H-Ras mutants that bind to either Raf or the PI3K catalytic subunit p110. They showed that interaction with Raf alone was capable of mediating angiogenesis, whereas interaction with p110 isoforms increased survival signaling and vascular permeability. In contrast, we modestly overexpressed a non-constitutively active H-Ras (<=10-fold over endogenous H-Ras) that requires the same activating and inactivating factors as the endogenous GTPase. Thus, our studies may better reflect physiological activation of H-Ras by VEGF and proangiogenic downstream effects.\n\nUnlike other growth factors, the requirement for H-Ras in VEGF-mediated activation of the ERK MAPK cascade in ECs is still debated. Although VEGF receptor activation promotes Ras activity via association with adaptor protein Grb2 (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR), we and others (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR) found that VEGF-induced ERK phosphorylation and downstream signaling strongly depends on PKC activation. Akt and eNOS phosphorylation are, however, unaffected by the PKC inhibitor Go6983 (data not shown). In support of Ras-mediated Akt signaling in angiogenesis, mice with a defective RBD in p110 show branching defects in their vascular lymphatic system and loss of Akt activation in response to growth factors in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (XREF_BIBR).\n\nSeveral studies investigated eNOS activity and  * NO production in response to VEGF at different membrane locations, revealing that eNOS at the PM is sensitive to early calcium-dependent activation, whereas eNOS at the endomembranes shows a delayed response associated with phosphorylation at Ser-1177 by Akt (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR).\n\nH-Ras interaction with cellular membranes is regulated by C-terminal lipid modifications. Farnesylation at cysteine 186 allows H-Ras to bind to endomembranes but not PM as our (XREF_FIGA) and other studies (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR) have shown. Single (either Cys-181 or Cys-184) or double S-palmitoylation, however, does lead to PM localization via Golgi vesicular transport. Interestingly, single S-palmitoylated N-Ras and H-Ras (C181S or C184S mutants) show faster depalmitoylation, resulting in shorter PM interaction compared with double S-palmitoylated H-Ras WT (XREF_BIBR). Utilizing the palmitoylation-deficient mutant H-Ras PalM, as a model for H-Ras endomembrane signaling, we uncovered a novel VEGF to H-Ras link that omits activation of the small GTPase at the PM and is sufficient for signaling PI3K/Akt/eNOS-mediated migration. Studies in various other cell types reported that wild type and constitutively active endomembrane H-Ras increase ERK signaling upon growth factor stimulation (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). Our studies in adult ECs stimulated with VEGF suggest, however, that ERK is stimulated by PKC, and endomembrane-localized H-Ras is responsible for stimulation of proangiogenic signaling via PI3K/Akt/eNOS. Indeed, our experiments using knockdown/H-Ras PalM reconstitution repeatedly showed increased Akt and eNOS phosphorylation (see XREF_FIG (B and C) and XREF_FIGC), demonstrating that VEGF can increase eNOS activity via H-Ras at the endomembranes, where it has been reported to cause local oxidative protein modifications, including S-nitrosylation (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). Nevertheless, the signaling mechanism from PM-bound GF receptors to the endomembranes is still in question and may vary in different cell types. Studies in EGF-stimulated COS-1 cells identified the calcium-sensitive Ras GRP1 guanosine exchange factor as an H-Ras activator at the endomembranes and provided evidence that growth factor stimulation of Src/PLCgamma activates guanosine exchange factors through increase in local calcium and DAG (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR).\n\nBy linking endomembrane H-Ras to VEGF-mediated EC migration, our studies have identified a novel mechanism for eNOS activation in adult ECs. We were able for the first time to assign endomembrane H-Ras an active part in EC signaling, relating it to the key PI3K/Akt/eNOS angiogenic signaling pathway that results in nitric oxide production
