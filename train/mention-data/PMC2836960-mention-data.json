The Ca 2+ -dependent activation of Raf1 is abrogated by knockdown of Shoc2. We show that the Shoc2 scaffold protein modulates Ras-dependent Raf1 activation in a Ca 2+ - and calmodulin-dependent manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nOn growth factor stimulation, many receptor-type or non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases are activated, followed by the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades, which regulate various aspects of cellular function, including the proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation of high eukaryotes (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). It is now widely accepted that, in addition to the canonical pathway mediated by adaptor proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Ras-family GTPases, other signaling cascades stimulated simultaneously by growth factors also play roles in the regulation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades. For example, various ligands activate or suppress the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades in a Ca 2+ - and calmodulin-dependent manner (reviewed in XREF_BIBR). The activities of many tyrosine kinases are regulated by Ca 2+ -regulated kinases, such as conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, the proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2 or calmodulin-dependent kinases (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Furthermore, Ras is also regulated either positively or negatively by Ca 2+ -responsive GEFs or GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs; reviewed in XREF_BIBR). Therefore, the effect of Ca 2+  on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is always the summation of the activity changes of these upstream regulators.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is not surprising that there are only a few reports that refer to the specific role of Ca 2+  in the signaling from Ras to Raf (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), because the role of calcium has been studied mostly in ligand-stimulated cells treated with calcium ionophores, calcium chelators, or calmodulin inhibitors. In PC12 cells, which respond to an increase in Ca 2+  concentration by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), it has been suggested that calmodulin directly or indirectly activates MEK (mitogen-activated protein [MAP]/ERK kinase) in a manner dependent on Ras, but independent of Raf, suggesting the presence of an unidentified MEK kinase (XREF_BIBR). In NIH3T3 cells, calmodulin binds to KRas, thereby decreasing activities of Raf and ERK (XREF_BIBR). In agreement with this observation, inhibition of calmodulin increases KRas-mediated Raf activation (XREF_BIBR). Intriguingly, calmodulin was shown to increase the signaling from HRas to Raf1 (XREF_BIBR). Therefore, the overall role of calmodulin in ERK signaling may be determined by the ratio of HRas and KRas and the cell-specific contribution of each isoform in Raf1 activation.\n\nThe Shoc2 protein, also known as Sur-8, which was originally identified as a pivotal regulator in the Ras/ERK MAP kinase cascade, has been found in all multicellular organisms (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). By two-hybrid analysis, Shoc2 was found to interact with Ras but not with other related small GTPases (XREF_BIBR). Shoc2 has also been found to form a complex with Raf1 in mammalian cells and to enhance the signaling strength of Ras by promoting the Ras-Raf1 interaction (XREF_BIBR). It has been reported that Erbin, a member of the leucine-rich repeat and PDZ domain family, inhibits the interaction of Shoc2 with Ras and Raf and thereby inhibits the Ras/ERK MAP kinase cascade, suggesting that the binding of Ras and Raf1 to the Shoc2 scaffold protein is also subject to regulation (XREF_BIBR). More recently, Shoc2 has been shown to associate with a phosphatase holoenzyme complex and to bind to MRas, thereby activating Raf1 by means of the dephosphorylation of 14-3-3 binding sites (XREF_BIBR).\n\nHere, by the use of a synthetic guanine nucleotide exchange factor named eGRF (XREF_BIBR), we have developed an experimental system wherein Ras can be rapidly activated without perturbing other signaling molecules. With this system in hand, we show that Shoc2 enhances Ras-dependent activation and plasma membrane translocation of Raf1 in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\nRas Activation Is Not Sufficient for the Activation of Raf1, MEK, and ERK.\n\nThere is ample evidence for the essential role of Ras in the EGF-mediated ERK activation. However, it has been uncertain whether Ras activation is sufficient for the full activation of ERK in EGF-stimulated cells, mainly because there has been no tool for activating Ras directly and specifically. To overcome this problem, we took advantage of a recombinant GEF named eGRF, which consists of the regulatory domain of Epac1, cAMP-responsive Rap1GEF, and the catalytic domain of RasGRF1 (XREF_BIBR). eGRF can be activated by 007, an Epac-specific cAMP agonist, without perturbing the PKA pathway. We stably transfected the eGRF expression plasmid into HeLa cells and established two cell lines, HeLa-eGRF1 and -eGRF2. Because the expression of Epac (Epac1 and Epac2) is mostly restricted to neuronal cells (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR) and is not detected in HeLa cells, 007 activates only the Ras protein in these cell lines. Administration of 007 activated Ras in HeLa-eGRF1 and -eGRF2 to the same degree as did administration of EGF (XREF_FIGA). ERK activation was measured by either reactivity to anti-active-ERK antibody or phosphorylation-dependent band-shift in the SDS-PAGE gel. To discriminate these two species of ERK, we refer them active ERK and phospho-ERK, respectively. We found ERK activation was significantly lower in 007-stimulated HeLa-eGRF cells than EGF-stimulated HeLa-eGRF cells (XREF_FIGB). As expected, neither Ras nor ERK was significantly activated by 007 in the parent HeLa cells. We further characterized HeLa-eGRF1 in the following studies. As shown in XREF_FIG, C and D, the time course and the strength of Ras activation by 007 were almost comparable to those by EGF. In contrast, the activations of Raf1, MEK, and ERK were markedly lower in 007-stimulated cells than in EGF-stimulated cells. In addition, we did not find any effect of 007 in EGF-stimulated cells, negating the possibility that 007 inhibited Raf1 activation independent of Ras (data not shown). The results clearly demonstrated that a certain quantitative level of Ras activation does not warrant subsequent full activation of Raf1, MEK, and ERK, suggesting the presence of a signal enhancer of Ras.\n\nIt is possible that the difference between EGF and 007 arises from the specificity of GEFs toward the Ras isoforms, HRas, KRas, and NRas. To exclude this possibility, we examined the levels of Ras-GTP with isoform-specific antibodies. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, we could detect KRas and NRas, but not HRas in HeLa cells. Both KRas and HRas were activated by 007 as efficiently as EGF. This observation agrees with the previous report showing that Ras isoforms are redundant for EGF-activated ERK activation and that HRas is a minor isoform in HeLa cells compared with KRas and NRas (XREF_BIBR). Thus, we used anti-pan Ras antibody in the following studies and did not discriminate the Ras isoforms, unless it is clearly stated.\n\n\n\nPhospholipase-mediated Ca 2+  Influx Enhances Ras-mediated ERK Activation.\n\nAs an initial screening for the signal enhancer of Ras, we examined the contribution of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), PKC, and phospholipase C (PLC) with specific inhibitors (XREF_FIG, A and B). Among them, we found that a PLC inhibitor U73122 suppressed EGF-induced ERK activation/phosphorylation to ca. 50% of the control. Because a PKC inhibitor Go6983 did not inhibit EGF-induced ERK activation, we speculated that a PLC-mediated increase in Ca 2+  influx enhanced the Ras-mediated ERK activation in a PKC-independent manner. An ionomycin-induced increase in Ca 2+  activated ERK, albeit much more weakly than did EGF (XREF_FIGC). In contrast, costimulation of Hela-eGRF1 cells with 007 and ionomycin induced ERK activation as early and strongly as did EGF in HeLa-eGRF1 cells (XREF_FIG, D and E). The ERK activation by 007 plus ionomycin was not suppressed by any of the inhibitors of PI3K, PKC, or PLC used in this study (data not shown). These observations strongly suggested that, in addition to the Ras activation, the PLC-mediated increase in Ca 2+  concentration is essential for the full activation of Raf1, MEK, and ERK in HeLa cells.\n\n\n\nCa 2+  Influx Promotes Raf1 Recruitment to Ras at the Plasma Membrane.\n\nTo understand the mechanism by which Ca 2+  activates Raf1, we used a FRET biosensor for Raf1, Prin-Raf1 (XREF_BIBR). The FRET level of this biosensor is high in the closed inactive conformation and low in the active open conformation. As we reported previously, upon EGF stimulation Prin-Raf1 moved from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and adopted an open active conformation in a Ras-dependent manner (XREF_FIGA, top). Pretreatment with the Ca 2+  chelator BAPTA almost completely inhibited Raf1 translocation and activation (XREF_FIGA, middle). This inhibitory effect of BAPTA could be overridden by costimulation with 007 and ionomycin (XREF_FIGA, bottom), probably because the ionomycin-induced increase in intracellular Ca 2+  concentration exceeded the concentration of BAPTA in the cells. Quantification of images more convincingly showed that the increase in the intracellular Ca 2+  concentration was essential for the Ras-mediated plasma membrane translocation and subsequent conformational change of Raf1 (XREF_FIGB).\n\n\n\nShoc2 Mediates Ca 2+  Enhancement of Raf1 Activation.\n\nThe observation that an increase in Ca 2+  concentration was required for Raf1 translocation to the plasma membrane led us to examine the contribution of scaffold proteins, which provide the platform for Ras binding to Raf1 (XREF_BIBR). During the course of screening with siRNA-mediated knockdown of scaffold proteins, we found that knockdown of Shoc2 inhibited EGF-induced Raf1 activation most prominently in HeLa cells. As shown in XREF_FIG, A and B, knockdown of Shoc2 inhibited plasma membrane translocation and conformational change of Raf1 not only by EGF stimulation but also costimulation with 007 and ionomycin. In these Shoc2-knockdown cells, the strengths and the time courses of Raf1 activation by EGF and 007 plus ionomycin were similar to those by 007 alone. Importantly, Shoc2 knockdown did not inhibit the weak Raf1 activation induced by 007 alone. These observations strongly suggested that the Ca 2+  enhancement of Raf1 activation was mediated primarily by Shoc2. We confirmed that the Ras activation was not inhibited by the knockdown of Shoc2 (XREF_FIGC). In fact, we observed an increase in the level of Ras activation in Shoc2-knockdown cells. This observation suggested that a negative feedback loop might be impaired in Shoc2-knockdown cells; however, we have not yet pursued this issue.\n\n\n\nShoc2 Mediates Ca 2+  Enhancement of Activation of MEK and ERK.\n\nIn agreement with the suppression of Raf1 activation by Shoc2 knockdown, the activation of both MEK and ERK was also suppressed by Shoc2 knockdown in cells stimulated with EGF or 007 plus ionomycin (XREF_FIGA and XREF_FIGB). This effect of Shoc2 knockdown was counteracted by the expression of Shoc2 cDNA, which was resistant to the siRNA used in this experiment, validating the specificity of siRNA against Shoc2 (XREF_FIG, C and D).\n\n\n\nA Calmodulin Inhibitor Enhances Raf1 Activation in a Shoc2-dependent Manner.\n\nTo gain further insight into the role of Ca 2+  and Shoc2 in Raf1 activation, we examined the effect of a competitive inhibitor of calmodulin, W-13, in HeLa-eGRF1 cells (XREF_FIGA). As reported previously (XREF_BIBR), W-13 alone increased Raf1 activation, albeit weakly. When cells were costimulated with W-13 and 007, Raf1 was activated significantly. Importantly, this W-13-mediated enhancement of 007-induced Raf1 activation was abolished by the ablation of Shoc2 (XREF_FIGB). This observation strongly suggested that calmodulin inhibited Shoc2-mediated binding of Ras to Raf1 and that Ca 2+  suppressed this calmodulin inhibition of Ras binding to Raf1.\n\nTo directly assess this possibility, we examined the Shoc2 binding to Ras upon W-13 treatment by the intermolecular FRET method with CFP-KRas and Shoc2-YFP (XREF_FIG). We found that the level of FRET increased significantly upon treatment with 007 and W-13 or 007 and ionomycin, indicating the Shoc2 association with KRas. In conclusion, the results shown here strongly argue that calmodulin inhibits Shoc2 association with Ras and thereby formation of the Ras-Shoc2-Raf1 complex and that Ca 2+  enhances Ras to Raf1 signaling by suppressing calmodulin's inhibition of Shoc2 binding to Ras. We performed similar experiments by using CFP-HRas and obtained essentially the same results (data not shown).\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nDeciphering the role of Ca 2+  on the growth factor-induced activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades is extremely difficult because of the pleiotropic effects of Ca 2+  on the activities and expression levels of a number of signaling molecules (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Therefore, for a more precise understanding of the role of Ca 2+  in each signaling step, the immediate upstream regulator must be activated to minimize the effect of signaling from the upstream regulators. Here, with the help of a synthetic GEF for Ras, eGRF, and its specific ligand, 007, we have shown that Ras requires additional signals from Ca 2+  for the full activation of Raf1. We propose for the following reasons that Shoc2 mediates this Ca 2+ -mediated enhancement of Raf1 activation. First, the level of Raf1 activation by 007 was similar to that by EGF in Shoc2-knockdown cells (XREF_FIGB). Second, the level of 007-mediated Raf1 activation could not be enhanced by ionomycin in Shoc2-knockdown cells (XREF_FIGB). Third, ionomycin could not enhance 007-induced activation of MEK and ERK in Shoc2-knock down cells (XREF_FIG). Fourth, W-13-mediated Raf1 activation was abolished by the ablation of Shoc2 (XREF_FIG). Finally, we found that both ionomycin and W-13 cooperated with 007 in the Shoc2 association with Ras (XREF_FIG).\n\nThe Shoc2- and Ca 2+ -mediated enhancement of the plasma membrane recruitment of Raf1 seems to be related to the negative regulation of Ras signaling by calmodulin. XREF_BIBR reported that calmodulin bound both KRas and Raf1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. In their study, Ca 2+ -bound calmodulin was suggested to inhibit KRas and thereby to suppress KRas-dependent ERK activation. Of note, they also observed that W-13-mediated inhibition of calmodulin has a positive effect on KRas signaling in the absence of any stimuli in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. This observation strongly suggests that the calcium concentration of the quiescent cells is sufficient to inhibit KRas in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Recently, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR reported that a calmodulin inhibitor induced association of HRas and KRas with Raf1 in COS-1 cells. This observation also supports the idea that calmodulin binds to HRas and KRas and suppresses their binding to Raf1 at the basal calcium concentration. In the Ca 2+ -gated K +  channel, calmodulin was shown to associate with the channel constitutively, and Ca 2+  triggered the conformational change of the calmodulin-K +  channel complex, thereby opening the gate (XREF_BIBR). In analogy to this, calmodulin may suppress spontaneous signaling from Ras to Raf1 at the basal calcium concentration and may allow Ras-GTP to bind to Raf1 only at a high calcium concentration.\n\nAlso taking into consideration our observations that Ca 2+  could induce Raf1 binding to Ras in a Shoc2-dependent manner (XREF_FIG) and that the number of molecules of Ras-GTP is in a large excess of that of Raf1 even in quiescent cells (XREF_BIBR), we propose the following scenario for the role of Shoc2 and calmodulin in Ras regulation (XREF_FIG). In the absence of Ca 2+ , calmodulin binds to Ras-GTP and inhibits it from binding to Shoc2. In the presence of a higher Ca 2+  concentration, Ca 2+ /calmodulin changes its conformation, thereby leaving Ras-GTP for binding with Shoc2. The complex of Shoc2 and Ras-GTP provides a platform for recruiting Raf1 to the plasma membrane, thereby triggering the MEK-ERK signaling cascade. W-13 inhibits calmodulin binding to Ras, thereby allowing Shoc2 to bind to Ras to enhance Ras binding to Raf1. In the absence of Shoc2, Ras binds to Raf1 with low efficiency, even if calmodulin is inhibited. In this scenario, 007 serves to increase the level of Ras-GTP and to increase the fraction of Shoc2 that associates with Ras-GTP. A potentially important player that we need to characterize in the future is M-Ras, which has been shown to bind to Shoc2 and PP1c-holoenzyme (XREF_BIBR). It is be possible that M-Ras is also suppressed by calmodulin and that Ca 2+  may contribute ERK activation via PP1c-mediated Raf1 activation.\n\nWe have shown that Ca 2+  induces dimerization of BRaf via the BRaf-specific N-terminal region of Raf1 (XREF_BIBR). Interestingly, calmodulin binds to Raf1 but not BRaf (XREF_BIBR). This observation may suggest that the binding between Ras-GTP and Raf proteins requires additional reinforcement from the Ca 2+  signaling pathway. The N-terminal BRaf-specific region and Shoc2 may play an equivalent role for BRaf and Raf1, respectively. In relation to this issue, we noted that the weak Raf1 activation by W-13 was independent of Shoc2, indicating that the Shoc2 enhancement of Raf1 binding to Ras-GTP could be manifested only in the presence of large amount of Ras-GTP (XREF_FIG). This observation might lead to another hypothesis that Shoc2 may facilitate the formation of a hetero-tetramer consisting of two Raf1 and two Ras-GTP molecules. Of note, the numbers of Raf1 and BRaf molecules in HeLa cells used in this study are 3 x 10 4 /cell and 2 x 10 3 /cell, respectively. Therefore, in the HeLa cells used in this study, the Shoc2-Raf1 pathway is dominant over BRaf.\n\nAnother scaffold protein for the Raf proteins, IQGAP1, has recently been shown to be regulated by Ca 2+ /calmodulin (XREF_BIBR). Addition of Ca 2+ , which binds to both BRaf and IQGAP1, resulted in a twofold increase in their binding to each other in vitro. This interaction was completely abolished in the presence of Ca 2+ /calmodulin. In agreement with this in vitro data, BAPTA increased the BRaf binding to IQGAP1 and concomitantly activated BRaf in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. EGF, which has been shown to increase the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca 2+  (XREF_BIBR), also promoted BRaf association with IQGAP1. Ca 2+  has been suggested to play a role in the negative feedback in this scheme; however, it is also possible that the substantial effect of calcium ionophores or chelators used in this study may reflect a change in the activity of Ras, which can be either positively or negative modulated by Ca 2+  (XREF_BIBR).\n\nWe have shown that inhibition of PLC suppressed EGF-induced ERK activation to ca. 50% of the full activation (XREF_FIG, A and B). This observation may contradict the previous report negating the role of PLCgamma1 in EGF-induced ERK activation in PLCgamma1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (XREF_BIBR). The reason for this discrepancy may be simply ascribable to the cell type difference or to the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, in which knockout of a gene often induces another gene to compensate for the defect.\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified a role played by Shoc2 and Ca 2+ /calmodulin in the signaling from Ras to Raf1. Needless-to-say, Ca 2+  modulates EGF signaling to ERK in many ways. For the future systemic analysis of this signaling cascade, it would be extremely important to establish methodology for the analysis of each step by insulating the effect of upstream regulators.
