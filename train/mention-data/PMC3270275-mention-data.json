We observed that loss of mitochondrial genome reversibly induced overexpression and activation of proto-oncogenic Ras, especially K-Ras 4A, responsible for the activation of AKT and ERK leading to advanced phenotype of prostate and breast cancer. Ras activation was induced by the overexpression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Hypoxia is known to induce proteasomal degradation of HMGR. Well differentiated prostate and breast cancer cells with high mitochondrial DNA content consumed a large amount of oxygen and induced hypoxia. Loss of mitochondrial genome reduced oxygen consumption and increased in oxygen concentration in the cells. The hypoxic-to-normoxic shift led to the overexpression of HMGR through inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Therefore, reduction of mitochondrial genome content induced overexpression of HMGR through hypoxic to normoxic shift and subsequently the endogenous induction of the mevalonate pathway activated Ras that mediates advanced phenotype. Reduction of mitochondrial genome content was associated with the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer in vitro cell line model and tissue specimens in vivo. Our results elucidate a coherent mechanism that directly links the mitochondrial genome with the advanced progression of the disease.\n\n\n\nProstate cancer (PCa) is a significant health problem, representing the leading cancer diagnosis and the second leading cause of cancer death in North American men. 1  PCa begins as an androgen-dependent cancer that undergoes clinical regression in response to pharmacological or surgical strategies that reduce testosterone concentration. Despite this treatment, the cancer frequently recurs as an androgen-independent or castration-resistant cancer with metastatic phenotype. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the development to an aggressive metastatic phenotype is a critical topic.\n\nMitochondria are essential organelles that generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. This process is accomplished by a series of protein complexes and mitochondrial respiratory chains encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Human mtDNA is remarkably small (16569bp) compared with nDNA (~10 9 bp) and encodes 13 proteins in the mitochondrial respiratory chains (MRC), 22 transfer RNAs, and 2 ribosomal RNAs. 2 \n\nSeveral reports showed that mutations of mtDNA had been identified in various types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, pancreatic and other cancers. 3  The growth advantage of cancer cells with specific mutant mtDNA has also been demonstrated in an in vivo mouse model system using cybrid (trans-mitochondrial hybrid) cells, suggesting that specific mutations of mtDNA give a survival advantage and induce metastasis. 4  In PCa specimens, Chen et al. 5  reported an extremely high incidence of somatic mutation (90%) in the D-loop region that may cause reduction of mtDNA content. 6 \n\nThe roles of mtDNA and mitochondrial respiratory function in biological functions has been demonstrated using mtDNA-deficient cells. 7  We previously showed that TNF and serum starvation could not induce apoptosis in mtDNA-depleted cells, whereas they induced apoptosis in parental cells and cells reconstituted with normal mtDNA. 8  These results indicate that mitochondrial respiratory function and mtDNA are critically important in apoptosis. We showed following observations to demonstrate the mechanisms involved in the induction of advanced phenotype of PCa by the reduction of mitochondrial genome content. Reduction of mtDNA content shifted (1) androgen-dependent PCa cells to an androgen-independent phenotype in vitro and in vivo 9  and induced (2) epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition changes that may lead to PCa progression, 10  (3) hypermethylation of CpG islands of the putative tumor suppressor genes 11  and (4) abnormal activation of NF-kappaB, 12  AP-1, 12  AKT, 13  ERK 10  and JNK 10  that may lead to aggressive phenotype in PCa progression.\n\nRas-GTPases are potential candidates that can transduce the constitutive and concurrent activation of a broad array of effectors such as ERK and AKT. As small GTPases, Ras are dynamically activated and inactivated with the association of GTP or GDP, respectively. Human cancers (~25%) often harbor (oncogenic) mutations in Ras that disable the ability of the GTPases to dynamically be inactivated, leading to the constitutive and concurrent activation of a diverse array of signal pathways, for example, Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. 14  Although tissue studies have revealed the constitutive and concurrent activation of ERK and Akt in the progression of PCa, the majority of PCa tumors do not harbor RAS mutation (oncogenes). 15  Yet, it is generally acknowledged that the aberrant activation of Ras can shift PCa from androgen-dependent to independent, 16  whereas the expression of dominant-negative Ras attenuates androgen-independent phenotype, 17  indicating that Ras activation is responsible for the phenotype of PCa. In the current study of PCa, we investigated a pathway of metabolic and proto-oncogenic processes including Ras activation that aberrantly activates ERK and Akt. We denoted this as the mitochondrial-generated progression signal (mitoGPS) that transduces changes in mitochondrial genome in the early-stages of PCa into the advanced progression of the disease.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nReduction of the mitochondrial genome content is associated with PCa progression.\n\nWe first investigated whether mitochondrial genome content changes associated with aggressive phenotype of PCa in human tissue specimens. Mitochondrial genomic analysis in a single cell revealed that the mitochondrial genome copy-number/cell was significantly reduced in high-grade tumors (Gleason grade 8 and 9) as compared with that in low-grade tumors (Gleason grade 6 and 7) (XREF_FIG) (P<0.01). The in vivo observations were verified in human cell lines the early stages androgen-dependent PCa (LNCaP), or an array of PCa (C4-2, PC-3 and DU-145). Classical cell lines for the in vitro evaluation of PCa, include: the castration sensitive LNCaP established from a metastatic (supraclavicular lymph node) lesion of human prostate adenocarcinoma; 18  the castration resistant (CR) C4-2 isolated from recurrent tumors that develop after castration of mice inoculated with LNCaP; 19  and CR PCa cell lines derived from metastasis in human bone (PC-3) and brain (DU-145).XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR In the current study, mitochondrial genomic analysis showed a low mitochondrial genome content in PC-3 and DU-145, in addition to a significant reduction in C4-2, relative to the parental LNCaP (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nReduction of the mitochondrial genome content reversibly induces the aberrant activation of ERK and Akt.\n\nWe evaluated the biological impact of the reduction of the mitochondrial genome content in the progression of PCa by the experimental depletion of the genome from LNCaP. We additionally utilized the MCF-7 cell line, a classical breast cancer (BCa) established from the metastasis (pleural effusion) of a human breast adenocarcinoma. 22  The knock-out of the mtDNA (mtDNA-KO) from LNCaP and MCF-7 was demonstrated in the creation of the LNrho0-8 and MCFrho0 cell lines, respectively.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR To confirm that experimental observations that follow the loss of the mitochondrial genome content are not of consequence to an incidental mutation to the nuclear genome induced by ethidium bromide treatment, the mitochondrial genome was reconstituted to the mtDNA-KO cell lines (LNrho0-8 and MCFrho0) in the creation of the mtDNA-knock in (mtDNA-KI) cells lines, denoted as LNCyb and MCFCyb.\n\nThe mitochondrial genome contents of the indicated cell lines were visually confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker Red and showed that presence of mitochondria in parental, mtDNA-KO and mtDNA-KI cells (XREF_FIG). Microscopic (confocal) images also show the abundance of the mtDNA probes localized in the mitochondria of the parental and mtDNA-KI cells; no mtDNA probes were observed in the mtDNA-KO cells (XREF_FIG). The results were confirmed by the quantification of the mitochondrial genome content by QRT-PCR (XREF_FIG); the mitochondrial genome content in LNCyb and MCFCyb was partially or completely restored, respectively, to that in LNCaP and MCF-7. We observed that the amount of ATP in LNCaP was significantly reduced in LNr0-8 (113.3+/-2.0 and 73.2+/-2.1nM/mg protein, respectively) (average+/-S.E., P-value=0.0056) and lactate generation was increased (1463+/-66 and 3416+/-82nM, respectively) (average+/-S.E., P-value=0.000049). The results suggest that loss of mitochondrial genome reduced ATP generation possibly by the reduction of oxidative phosphorylation that might increase in anaerobic glycolysis.\n\nIt is well documented that ERK and Akt are constitutively activated in the progression of advanced PCa tumors. 15  Our data reveal ERK and Akt to be constitutively activated in the mtDNA-KO of PCa and BCa, relative to the parental and mtDNA-KI cells (XREF_FIG). Of the ERKs, that is, ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42), ERK2 was the most dramatically phosphorylated in LNrho0-8 and MCFrho0.\n\n\n\nReduction of the mitochondrial genome content in PCa and BCa constitutively activates Ras.\n\nThe interaction of activated GTP-bound Ras with the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1, 23  generates GTP-bound Ras-Raf complexes that lead to the activation of ERK and Akt.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR We investigated whether Ras is activated by depletion of mitochondrial genome. No active Ras was pulled-down from the total-protein lysates (160mug) of parental (LNCaP and MCF-7) cells in comparison with a positive control (XREF_FIG). Meanwhile, active Ras from mtDNA-KO was observed even when the quantity of LNrho0-8 and MCFrho0 lysates probed was reduced to 0.5mug or 5mug, respectively, active Ras was observed as two bands of intensity similar to the positive control (XREF_FIG). The experiment demonstrates that the depletion of the mitochondrial genome in PCa leads to the constitutive activation of Ras. Association of the reduction of mitochondrial genome content with the activation of Ras was verified in an array of PCa C4-2, PC-3 and DU-145 that harbor low mitochondrial genome contents, relative to the early stages of PCa LNCaP (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG).\n\nThe shift of normal epithelial cells to the early-stages of PCa and BCa is associated with the genetic silencing of RasGAPs, particularly the DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein (DAB2IP). 26  The attenuation of DAB2IP activity in PCa diminishes the cells ability to amplify the GTPase activity of Ras, leading to the prolonged accumulation of active GTP-bound Ras. 27  We observed the expression of DAB2IP to be expressed in the prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), but not in all PCa including LNCaP, C4-2, DU-145 and PC-3 (XREF_FIG). Collectively the experiments demonstrate that the shift of normal prostate epithelial cells to PCa is associated with a silencing of a RasGAP that is not enough to explain why Ras is not activated in early stages of PCa LNCaP.\n\n\n\nReduction of the mitochondrial genome content in PCa overexpresses proto-oncogenic K-Ras 4A.\n\nThe human cell contains three nuclear-encoded RAS genes that encode four isoforms of Ras: H-Ras, N-Ras and two splice variations of K-Ras, K-Ras 4A and K-Ras 4B. We observed the protein level of K-Ras 4A to be greatly elevated in the mtDNA-KO (LNrho0-8 and MCFrho0), relative to the parental cells. Reconstitution of the mitochondrial genome to the mtDNA-KO attenuated the aberrant K-Ras 4A expression (XREF_FIG). Expression level of K-Ras 4A in mtDNA-KO cells was exceptionally high as compared with that of K-Ras 4B, H-Ras and N-Ras. A similar expression pattern was observed for the transcript levels of K-Ras 4A (XREF_FIG). Association of the reduction of mitochondrial genome content with increased expression of K-Ras 4A was verified in an array of PCa C4-2, PC-3 and DU-145 that harbor low mitochondrial genome contents, relative to the early stages of PCa LNCaP (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG).\n\nWe note that the constitutive activation of Ras observed with the depletion of the mitochondrial genome was not a consequence of oncogenic mutation in nucleotide sequences that encode for codons 12, 13 or 61 of K-Ras. 28  In a subsequent experiment we demonstrated that silencing of K-RAS in LNrho0-8, by transfection of K-RAS siRNA, reduced the expression of K-Ras 4A and the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, but not total ERK nor total AKT (XREF_FIG). Collectively, the experiments demonstrate that the reduction of the mitochondrial genome leads to the aberrant expression and activation of Ras, predominantly proto-oncogenic K-Ras 4A, and a process that is reversible with the reconstitution of the mitochondrial genome.\n\n\n\nHMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase) expression is responsible for the aberrant activation of Ras mediated by the reduction of the mitochondrial genome content.\n\nRas must translocate to cellular membrane by post-translational modifications that enable the (GTP-bound) Ras-Raf complexes to activate effectors at cellular membranes. 29  Localization of Ras to the cellular membrane is mediated by the prenylation of Ras, that is, the addition of farnesyl to the first cysteine (CAAX) of the C-terminus. 30  Farnesyl moieties for the prenylation of Ras are derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate of the mevalonate pathway that is catalytically transferred by farnesyltransferase (FTase). 31 \n\nImmunohistochemical analysis confirmed that expression of Ras was greatly increased in LNrho0-8 as compared with LNCaP (XREF_FIG). XREF_FIG also demonstrates that Ras located only in cytosolic fraction in LNCaP and cellular membrane and certain organelle in LNrho0-8 suggesting that the depletion of the mitochondrial genome signals the localization of Ras to the cellular membrane and specific organelle. Farnesylation of Ras can be repressed with lovastatin-mediated inhibition of the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway - the metabolism of HMG-CoA to mevalonate by HMGR. 32  Addition of lovastatin to the culture of LNrho0-8 generated the cytosolic accumulation of Ras, in addition to a shift to LNCaP-like cell morphology, both of which were reversed with co-application of exogenous mevalonate (XREF_FIG). To directly inhibit the farnesylation of Ras, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have been designed as peptidomimetics of the C-terminus (CAAX) of Ras. 32  The supplementation of lovastatin or FTI-276 diminished the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in LNrho0-8 (XREF_FIG). The results suggest that the endogenous activity of the mevalonate pathway is necessary for the constitutive activation of Ras in LNrho0-8.\n\nThen, we further investigated the potential cause for upregulation of mevalonate pathway. We observed an elevation of the expression of HMGR with the depletion of the mitochondrial genome (LNrho0-8) could be attenuated with the reconstitution of the genome (LNCyb) (XREF_FIG). We also observed the expression of HMGR was enhanced associated with the reduction of the mitochondrial genome content in PCa cell lines (XREF_FIG). These results indicate that an elevation in the endogenous expression of HMGR is responsible for the activation of Ras when the mitochondrial genome content is reduced.\n\n\n\nInhibition of mitochondrial respiration is responsible for HMGR expression possibly through the inhibition of proteasomal degradation.\n\nMitochondrial genome encodes 13 proteins in MRC and therefore reduction of mitochondrial genome leads to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. To determine if the induction of HMGR expression is induced by the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, LNCaP cells were cultured in the absence or presence of inhibitors of various complexes of the MRC: rotenone inhibits complex I; antimycin A inhibits complex III; oligomycin inhibits Fo-ATPase of complex V. Rotenone, antimycin A and oligomycin at the concentration used inhibited the oxygen consumption rate of LNCaP (32.6%, 35.2% and 34.4%, respectively) and enhanced the expression of HMGR (XREF_FIG).\n\nHMGR is regulated by multiple feedback mechanisms, including: transcriptional and/or translational regulation, PTMs, and/or proteasomal degradation by both sterol and non-sterol products of the mevalonate pathway. 33  We investigated whether proteasomal degradation is associated with high expression of HMGR. Incubation with proteasomal inhibitor N-[N-(N-Acetyl-L-leucyl)-L-leucyl]-L-norleucine (ALLN) in LNCaP increased the protein level of HMGR (XREF_FIG), suggesting that early stage PCa maintain low expression level of HMGR by proteasomal degradation.\n\n\n\nHMGR expression in PCa is enhanced by the hypoxic-to-normoxic shift.\n\nA recent study has demonstrated that hypoxia induces the proteasomal degradation of HMGR.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR As expected, oxygen consumption is well associated with the content of mitochondrial genome in PCa cell lines (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). From this observation, we hypothesized that LNCaP cells induce hypoxia by high consumption rate of oxygen leading to hypoxia-induced HMGR degradation, and that in advanced PCa the hypoxic state is retarded with the inhibition of respiration, that is, by the reduction of mitochondrial genome content, leading to the accumulation of HMGR expression. Interestingly, the oxygen concentration of surrounding cells was greatly reduced with the culture of LNCaP and MCF-7, as observed with the induction of hypoxia (12.3 and 4.2muM, respectively) in an hour (XREF_FIG respectively). The hypoxia-inducing activity of the parental cells was greatly reduced with the depletion of the mitochondrial genome, and recovered with the reconstitution of the genome (XREF_FIG). To investigate whether the hypoxic-to-normoxic shift induced by the reduction of mitochondrial genome content augments the expression of HMGR, the oxygen condition in the culture of LNCaP cells was increased (30%, 310muM) to establish an increased intracellular oxygen condition. The expression of HMGR and the phosphorylation of ERK were amplified within 6h of culture in the enriched oxygen condition (XREF_FIG). The study was further refined by the culture of LNrho0-8 in low oxygen environments to exogenously induce a normoxic-to-hypoxic shift in LNrho0-8. The greatly reduced-oxygen condition (0.2%, 2.1muM), but not 1, 5 or 20%, attenuated the expression of HMGR and the phosphorylation of ERK (XREF_FIG), within 6h of culture in the 0.2% oxygen environments (XREF_FIG). The data indicate that hypoxic-to-normoxic or normoxic-to-hypoxic shifts regulate the protein levels of the HMGR enzyme. We observed the hypoxia-inducing activity of advanced PCa cell lines to be low (XREF_FIG), an observation that correlates with the oxygen consumption (XREF_FIG) and the dysregulation/reduction of the steady state of the mitochondrial genome content in the progression of PCa (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nEndogenous or exogenous induction of the mevalonate pathway in PCa signals the progression of the advanced phenotype in vitro and in vivo.\n\nTo verify that exogenous androgens amplify the viability of the early-stages PCa, LNCaP were cultured in androgen-deprived media without (XREF_FIG) or with synthetic androgen (R1881) (XREF_FIG). Meanwhile, the androgen-deprived media was supplemented with exogenous mevalonate to induce the mevalonate pathway in the absence or presence of exogenous androgen (XREF_FIG, respectively). XREF_FIG demonstrates that exogenous androgens amplify the growth and proliferation of LNCaP in a dose-dependent fashion that is diminished in the presence of exogenous mevalonate. Alternatively, mevalonate alone supports growth in the absence of exogenous androgen (XREF_FIG). The experiment reveals that exogenous mevalonate induces androgen independence.\n\nIn subsequent experiments we evaluated the essentialness of the endogenous mevalonate pathway on the viability of PCa that harbor or are devoid of the mitochondrial genome. The viability of LNrho0-8 was significantly diminished in the presence of lovastatin, relative to the parental and mtDNA-KI cells (XREF_FIG); the lovastatin-mediated inhibition of the viability of the mtDNA-KO was prevented by mevalonate (XREF_FIG). The experiments demonstrate that a reduction of the mitochondrial genome content in PCa is transduced into the advanced phenotype via an endogenous induction of the mevalonate pathway.\n\nLNCaP cells are known to gradually acquire more aggressive growth within in vitro and in vivo environments.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR In order to investigate, in vivo, the role of mevalonate pathway in the shift of LNCaP to more aggressive growth phenotype, we inoculated LNCaP cells into athymic nude mice. Following the development of tumors with diameters of 9-10mm, mice were randomly assigned to four experimental groups as follows; (1) control, (2) lovastatin, (3) mevalonate and (4) lovastatin and mevalonate. The mean tumor volume for each group was quantified on Day 0 (pre-treatment): 377+/-105, 336+/-106, 454+/-86 and 383+/-44 (average+/-S.D. mm 3 ). Subsequently, pumps were utilized to systemically deliver either mevalonate (group 3 and group 4) or isotonic saline (group 1 and group 2) into mice, whereas lovastatin was consumed in the diet of mice of group 2 and group 4. XREF_FIG demonstrates that the progressive growth of LNCaP (group 1) in mice was significantly reduced with the treatment of lovastatin (group 2); the growth inhibitory effect of lovastatin was reversed with exogenous mevalonate (group 4). Meanwhile, the administration of exogenous mevalonate alone (group 3) slightly but significantly enhanced the growth of LNCaP. These results indicate that the mevalonate pathway is responsible for in vivo advanced growth in the xerographic model of PCa.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nOur collective report demonstrates in PCa that the (1) inhibition of respiration, by reduction of the mitochondrial genome content, shifts cells from a hypoxic-to-normoxic state (2) that attenuates the endogenous proteasomal degradation of the HMGR enzyme; (3) the increase in mevalonate pathway (4) induces the constitutive activation of nuclear-encoded proto-oncogenic Ras (5) that signal for an array of cancer progression signals (XREF_FIG). We denote the coherent series of events as the mitoGPS.\n\nThe pathological condition of a deprivation in an adequate oxygen supply to the body is referred to as hypoxia, a condition that is transduced at the molecular level into hypoxia-related signals that allow a cell(s) to adjust to the extracellular environment. We are the first to directly establish the mitochondrion as a direct physiological source of hypoxia in an in vitro system. Our results demonstrate that the reduction of the mitochondrial genome content diminishes the hypoxic state of the early stages of PCa and BCa, generating a hypoxic-to-hyperoxic shift in the oxygen content that is transduced into the overexpression of HMGR; subsequently, the induction of the mevalonate pathway activates proto-oncogenic Ras that signals the constitutive and concurrent activation of a diverse array of cancer progression pathways that advance the disease. Reports indicate that hypoxia inhibits lanosterol demethylase, an oxygen requiring enzyme, and accumulates lanosterol (molecules in cholesterol pathway) and that accumulation of lanosterol induces Insig-mediated degradation of HMGR. Hypoxia also activates HIF-1 to induce expression of insig.XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR Whether this pathway is activated in our system is now under investigation. The roles of ROS may not be likely as mtDNA-deficient cells generate reduced superoxide. 38 \n\nWith primary PCa composed of a mixture of cells with high or low mitochondrial genome content, 39  cells with high mitochondrial content may generate more hypoxia-induced changes that benefit the growth and maintenance of both groups under high cell density conditions, that is, the primary tumor site. In contrast, we speculate in the initiation of metastasis that the progressive induction of hyperoxia with the reduction of cell-density further enhances the mitoGPS, advancing the phenotype of cancer that harbor a reduced copy-number of the mitochondrial genome. It is plausible that the mitoGPS is a ubiquitous (patho)physiological response to the etiology and/or progression of a broad spectrum of human diseases that are attributed to respiratory incompetent mitochondria in various degenerative diseases (e.g., metabolic syndrome and diabetes). For example, as K-Ras 4A is responsible for aldosterone signaling, 40  the roles of mtDNA changes on hypertension is implicated.\n\nIn conclusion, our report has identified an intricate interaction of
