We demonstrate here that expression of PTEN selectively inhibits  activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)  pathway. PTEN expression in glioblastoma cells lacking the protein resulted in inhibition of integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation. Epidermal growth factor  (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- induced MAPK activation were also blocked. To determine the specific point of inhibition in the Ras/Raf/ MEK/ERK pathway, we examined these components  after stimulation by fibronectin or growth factors. Shc  phosphorylation and Ras activity were inhibited by expression of PTEN, whereas EGF receptor autophosphorylation was unaffected. The ability of cells to  spread at normal rates was partially rescued by coexpression of constitutively activated MEK1, a downstream component of the pathway. In addition, focal  contact formation was enhanced as indicated by paxillin staining. The phosphatase domain of PTEN was essential for all of these functions, because PTEN with an  inactive phosphatase domain did not suppress MAP kinase or Ras activity. In contrast to its effects on ERK,  PTEN expression did not affect c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) or PDGF-stimulated Akt. Our data suggest  that a general function of PTEN is to down-regulate  FAK and Shc phosphorylation, Ras activity, downstream MAP kinase activation, and associated focal  contact formation and cell spreading.\n\n\n\nPTEN is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene  that is a dual specificity phosphatase. The PTEN  gene also has an NH 2 -terminal domain with extensive homology to tensin, a protein that interacts with actin  filaments at focal adhesions. Deletions and mutations  within the PTEN gene have been observed in multiple  forms of human cancer, including brain, breast, prostate,  and other advanced malignancies (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). In addition, germ-line PTEN  mutations have been detected in two autosomal-dominant  disorders, Cowden disease, which confers an elevated risk  for tumors of the breast and thyroid, and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, which is characterized by hamartomas  and increased susceptibility to breast and thyroid cancer  (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).\n\nPTEN encodes the catalytic motif of protein tyrosine  phosphatases, and is able to dephosphorylate serine, threonine and tyrosine residues; it is thus considered a dual-specificity phosphatase (XREF_BIBR). Recent data  indicate that an intact catalytic phosphatase domain is essential for the known functions of PTEN. For example,  wild-type PTEN has growth suppressor activity in glioma  cells, but mutated PTEN with inactivated phosphatase activity does not (XREF_BIBR, and our own unpublished data). We recently found that PTEN can dephosphorylate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 1  in vitro and in  vivo, and inhibits cell spreading and cell migration on extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (FN) and  vitronectin (XREF_BIBR). Based on these observations, we wondered whether PTEN might affect integrin-mediated signal transduction pathways.\n\nThe interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix via  cell surface integrins generates a series of complex signaling events that serve to regulate several aspects of cell behavior, including growth, differentiation, adhesion, and  motility (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Intensive studies  have showed that integrin ligation can trigger activation of  certain MAP kinases, especially extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) members (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).  Subsequent apparently conflicting studies have reported  that FAK is involved in integrin-triggered ERK signaling  (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), or is  not involved (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR) and that  Ras is required (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR) or that is not required (XREF_BIBR) for  integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation.\n\nOn the other hand, activation of growth factor receptors  such as EGF receptor is well-known to stimulate nucleotide exchange on the Ras protein, which participates in  activation of the Raf family, which then sequentially phosphorylates and activates the downstream components  MAP or ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2 (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Other types of MAP kinases have distinct pathways and functions. For example,  c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase  (JNK/SAPK) is not activated by EGF receptors, but it can  be activated by integrin clustering (XREF_BIBR),  or by treatment of cells with inflammatory cytokines or  stresses such as UV irradiation (XREF_BIBR).\n\nIntegrins can collaborate or synergize functionally with  growth factors in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation (XREF_BIBR).  Among other mechanisms, integrin-growth factor synergy  or collaboration can involve the MAP kinase pathway,  e.g., associated with altered EGF receptor and PDGF receptor phosphorylation (XREF_BIBR).\n\nSince integrins and growth factors can each separately  stimulate this pathway or function collaboratively, and  since the MAP kinase pathway has been implicated as a  regulator of such a wide variety of effects on cell growth  and differentiation, in the present study we tested whether  the tumor suppressor PTEN affects this central signaling  pathway. It has already been shown in Meyers et al. (1997)  that isolated PTEN cannot dephosphorylate ERK2 in  vitro. Nevertheless, there are a variety of upstream steps  necessary for MAP kinase activation that might be targets  of PTEN. We have therefore searched for effects of PTEN  on activities or phosphorylation levels of several components of the Ras/ERK signal transduction pathway, and  have found that reconstitution of expression of PTEN in a  cell line devoid of this protein due to mutation markedly  inhibited Ras/ERK pathway activation in response to  stimulation by fibronectin or growth factors. Furthermore,  this inhibition by PTEN acted on Shc phosphorylation and  Ras activation, but not at the level of EGF receptor phosphorylation induced by EGF.\n\nTo test a biological function of MAP kinase in these  glioma cells, we cotransfected PTEN with constitutively  activated MEK1. We found that the resultant MAP kinase  activation could antagonize PTEN function and partially  rescue cell spreading on fibronectin impaired by PTEN.  We conclude that PTEN inhibits Ras activity, and then the  Ras/ERK common MAP kinase pathway for integrin- and  growth factor-mediated signaling, and finally alters cell  behavior.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nPTEN Inhibition of MAP Kinase Activation Stimulated  by Fibronectin.\n\nAlthough it is now well-established that PTEN is frequently deleted or mutated in a variety of tumors and tumor cell lines including glioblastomas, the biological functions of PTEN are poorly understood. Because we found  recently that PTEN can help to regulate integrin-dependent cell spreading and focal adhesion formation (XREF_BIBR), we examined integrin-mediated signaling  pathways. We measured the kinetics of ERK activation  stimulated by adhesion to fibronectin in U-87MG, a glioblastoma cell line missing PTEN protein due to a frameshift mutation (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Within 10  min after plating on fibronectin, approximately twofold increases in MAP kinase activation were detected as measured by increased phosphorylation of the ERK substrate  Elk-1 in nontransfected and control cells transfected with  GFP plasmid without insert                  . \n\nIn contrast, reconstitution of full-length wild-type PTEN- GFP to levels 1-1.5 times the level in human fibroblasts  (confirmed by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-PTEN antibody; data not shown), resulted in suppression  of MAP kinase activation, such that there was no increase  in Elk-1 phosphorylation at 10 min, and sharply decreased  MAP kinase activity within 30 min as compared with controls                         . The differences were significant at  the P < 0.0001 level. Conversely, reduction of endogenous  PTEN levels by anti-sense RNA expression in NIH 3T3  cells (XREF_BIBR) resulted in a 1.4 +/- 0.2-fold increase in MAP kinase activation (difference significant at  the P < 0.05 level). This result supports the notion that  PTEN normally acts as a brake or suppressor of MAP kinase activation. These findings were confirmed by direct  examination of ERK2 phosphorylation by immunoblotting with phospho-ERK2 antibody, which identifies the  characteristic phosphorylation of activated ERK2                   . The inhibition of MAP kinase activation after PTEN  expression was not accompanied by any change in cell viability (~95% viability by trypan blue assay with or without  PTEN expression).\n\n\n\nEffects of PTEN on Activation of MAP Kinase Kinase,  JNK, or Akt.\n\nIt has been reported that PTEN cannot dephosphorylate  isolated, activated ERK2 in vitro (XREF_BIBR). We  examined whether PTEN affects the FN-stimulated phosphorylation level of MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), which  is the component immediately upstream of ERK in the  Ras/ERK classic signaling pathway. We performed cotransfections of GFP or GFP-PTEN with wild-type HA-MEK1,  immunoprecipitated homogenates with anti-HA antibody,  and then immunoblotted with anti-phospho-MEK1, which  recognizes only activated MEK1/2. The increased phosphorylation of MEK1 stimulated by FN was significantly  inhibited in GFP-PTEN expressing cells as compared with  cells expressed GFP tag only                  . Previous experiments have indicated that growth suppression and inhibition of integrin-mediated spreading and focal adhesion  formation in glioma cells requires a functional PTEN phosphatase catalytic domain (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). As shown in Fig. XREF_FIG A, the pattern of induction of  MEK1 phosphorylation in cells transfected with the PTEN  phosphatase-inactive mutant C124A was the same as controls without insert. This result demonstrates a similar requirement for the PTEN phosphatase domain in its downmodulation of MAP kinase activation. \n\nIn contrast to the effects of PTEN on ERK activation,  there were no significant effects on JNK activation after  stimulation by UV irradiation                   or Akt phosphorylation (a target of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase) stimulated by PDGF                  . Identical induced patterns of  JNK phosphorylation were observed in all three transient  transfectants, including wild-type PTEN and the C124A  mutant                  . Under all conditions, an additional high- molecular mass band was observed by anti-HA-JNK1  staining, which may represent additional phosphorylation  independent of the sites evaluated by the anti-phospho-JNK antibody (which recognizes phosphorylated Ser 63  and Ser 73); however, again no differences levels of this  band due to PTEN were observed                  . For examining Akt phosphorylation levels, we performed cotransfection of GFP or GFP-PTEN with a puromycin resistance  plasmid. U-87MG cells were cotransfected with GFP vector or GFP-PTEN and a puromycin resistance plasmid,  and selected using puromycin for 3 d. This selection for  transient transfectants resulted in ~90% positive cells expressing GFP or GFP-PTEN as determined by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. XREF_FIG C, PTEN expression  had no detectable effect on Akt phosphorylation stimulated by PDGF.\n\n\n\nMAP Kinase Activation by Growth Factors Is Also  Blocked by PTEN Expression.\n\nBoth integrins and growth factors can stimulate ERK activation. DTBRG-05MG glioma cells expressing EGF but  not PDGF receptors displayed ERK activation in response to EGF, e.g., in control cells expressing GFP without PTEN insert                  . This activation was not  blocked by 50 nM wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol  3'-kinase inhibitor (data not shown). However, EGF stimulation of ERK activation was suppressed in PTEN-expressing cells                  . ERK2 activity was assayed using MBP  as a substrate                     . The differences between effects  of EGF in cells that expressed wild-type PTEN versus mutant PTEN were significant at the P < 0.0001 level                      . PTEN also inhibited MEK1 phosphorylation stimulated by either PDGF or FBS in U-87MG cells                  .  Similarly, PTEN was found to inhibit MEK1 phosphorylation in DTBRG-05MG cells, as well as ERK activation after EGF stimulation in U-87MG cells (data not shown).  Taken together, these results suggested that PTEN might  block the MAP kinase pathway at some point upstream of  MEK that might be common to both integrin- and growth  factor-mediated signaling pathways. \n\n\n\nPTEN Does Not Inhibit EGF Receptor Phosphorylation.\n\nIntegrin cooperation with growth factors can include  marked changes in the state of growth factor receptor autophosphorylation (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Therefore, we examined for PTEN regulation of  EGF receptor phosphorylation levels. Interestingly, PTEN  expression had no detectable effect on EGF receptor autophosphorylation stimulated by EGF in the three transfectant glioma cell lines. As shown in Fig. XREF_FIG, EGF stimulation in U-87MG cells expressing wild-type PTEN had the  same levels of receptor phosphorylation as in control cells  or in those transfected with mutant PTEN. We compared  the effects of PTEN on FAK phosphorylation levels in  these same cell lines, since we recently found that PTEN  dephosphorylates FAK in vivo and in vitro and inhibits  FAK phosphorylation stimulated by FN (XREF_BIBR). In this study, we observed that wild-type PTEN  inhibited FAK phosphorylation stimulated by EGF,  whereas phosphatase-inactive mutant PTEN permitted  the induction of FAK phosphorylation                . \n\n\n\nPTEN Inhibition of Ras Activation.\n\nRas has been suggested as an initial component in common between integrin- and growth factor-mediated MAP  kinase signaling pathways. Therefore, we speculated that  the ability of PTEN inhibit both integrin- and growth factor-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathways might be  due to PTEN inhibiting Ras activation. We tested for effects on activation in the EGF pathway by examining Ras  GTP loading in EGF-stimulated cells. As shown in Fig. XREF_FIG,  transfection with GFP tag or mutant GFP-PTEN still permitted substantial increases in GTP loading of Ras by a  factor of 2.1-2.6-fold over nonstimulated controls. However, cells transfected with wild-type GFP-PTEN were unable to generate significant increases in GTP loading of  Ras over controls after EGF stimulation                . The differences between effects of EGF in cells that expressed  wild-type GFP-PTEN and GFP tag or mutant GFP-PTEN  were significant at the P < 0.0001 level. We also performed cotransfection of wild-type GFP-PTEN with constitutively activated H-Ras, and found that PTEN could  not block its ability to induce ERK2 phosphorylation  (data not shown). These results identify the initial Ras activation step as an upstream source of PTEN inhibition of  MAP kinase activation. \n\n\n\nPTEN Inhibits Shc phosphorylation and Grb2 Recruitment.\n\nThe adapter protein Shc has been implicated in the Ras  signaling pathway in growth factor-stimulated cells by virtue of its association with the Grb2 adapter molecule. In  stimulated cells, Shc binds to the activated growth factor  receptor and becomes phosphorylated. Upon phosphorylation, Shc interacts with the SH2 domain of Grb2 and  functions as an alternative docking site for the Grb2-Sos  complex (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). As  shown in Fig. XREF_FIG, Shc has three isoforms of 66, 52, and 46 kD,  which derive from differential translation initiation at  three ATG sites (XREF_BIBR). U-87MG cells  expressing wild-type PTEN showed substantial suppression of Shc phosphorylation after EGF stimulation (especially the 52-kD isoform, which showed a 61 +/- 9% reduction compared with control Shc phosphorylation; Fig. XREF_FIG,  upper middle). Consistent with this effect, recruitment of  Grb2 was also downregulated by PTEN expression                               . However, quantities of EGF receptor associated with Shc                      showed no detectable differences between control and PTEN-expressing cells, consistent with the finding that PTEN does not inhibit EGF  receptor phosphorylation. PTEN also inhibited Shc phosphorylation stimulated by FN binding to integrins (data  not shown). \n\n\n\nExperimental Activation of MAP Kinase Partially  Rescues Cell Spreading Impaired by PTEN Expression.\n\nTo investigate the role of MAP kinase activation in a putative cell biological function of PTEN, we used a transient  cotransfection assay that permitted restoration of MAP kinase activation impaired by PTEN expression using constitutively activated MEK1, a downstream component of  the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. Our recent studies had  indicated that PTEN affects cell spreading on FN by human fibroblasts, as well as by U-87MG and DBTRG-05MG glioma cell lines, though the duration of PTEN effects differed. In human foreskin fibroblasts, the effect on  spreading was maximal at 20-30 min after adhesion to fibronectin, but diminished after 2 h. However, clear inhibition of cell spreading could be observed even after 18 h in  DBTRG-05MG cells (XREF_BIBR). These cell-type differences may be explained by the fact that human  fibroblasts express endogenous PTEN, whereas U-87MG  and DBTRG-05MG cells do not express the protein due to  mutations. The morphology of PTEN-expressing U-87MG  cells includes thin cell processes somewhat resembling  these of oligodendroglial cells (XREF_BIBR). In this  study, we compared cell spreading at 10 min in three  glioma cell lines: U-87MG, DBTRG-05MG and U-373MG;  FN stimulation of ERK activation is maximal at this time  point in these cells. Overexpression of constitutively activated MEK1 was accompanied by two- to fivefold increases in ERK activity compared with wild-type MEK1  stimulated by FN. Of particular interest, cotransfection of  constitutively activated MEK1 with wild-type PTEN partially rescued cell spreading and focal contact formation.  As shown in Fig. XREF_FIG A, the enhancement of focal contact  formation was apparent by paxillin staining. The proportion of cells capable of spreading increased by >65%, rising from a value of 31% of total cells spread with PTEN  alone to 52% in cells with PTEN plus activated MEK1                   . The differences in cell spreading were significant at the P < 0.01 level. In contrast, parallel cooverexpression of constitutively activated MEK1 with the PTEN  controls of GFP alone or mutant GFP-PTEN had no effect  on cell spreading and focal contact formation (data not  shown). Because we had previously shown that FAK overexpression could also partially rescue the cell spreading response, we performed a triple transfection experiment  combining PTEN, FAK, and activated MEK1. The results  showed no further rescue of cell spreading, with the percentages of cell spreading when cotransfected with PTEN  as follows: active MEK1 = 50 +/- 3%; HA-FAK = 52 +/-  5%; and active MEK1 + HA-FAK = 49 +/- 6%. This result  strongly suggests a linear rather than parallel biological  pathway, consistent with a downstream effect of PTEN on  MEK and ERK through FAK for cell spreading. \n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nMany recent studies have established that the PTEN gene  is deleted or mutated in a wide variety of tumor tissues  and tumor cell lines, as well as in two genetic disorders  with predisposition to cancer (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Furthermore, transfected PTEN  suppresses cell growth and tumorigenicity in glioblastoma  cell lines (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Therefore, PTEN is considered a major new tumor suppressor.\n\nOne theoretically attractive site of action of PTEN  might be on the MAP kinases, which comprise central cellular regulatory pathways. In this report, we tested for effects of PTEN on integrin- and growth factor-mediated  MAP kinase signaling. Our major findings are summarized  in Fig. XREF_FIG, and include the following: (a) activation of the  ERK type of MAP kinase is inhibited by PTEN expression  in cells lacking the protein, whether stimulated by integrin  ligation or a growth factor, yet the JNK/SAPK MAP kinase pathway and Akt are unaffected; (b) expression of  anti-sense PTEN to reduce PTEN in cells that normally  express this protein results in ERK activation; (c) upstream MEK and Ras activation and Shc phosphorylation  are inhibited, but EGF receptor phosphorylation is not  affected; (d) the inhibition of Ras can be overcome by  expression of activated Ras; and (e) overexpression of an  activated downstream component of the pathway, MEK1,  can antagonize the biological effects of PTEN on cell spreading and focal contact formation. Our results strongly suggest that down-regulation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway  is an important function of the PTEN tumor suppressor  gene in its cell biological functions. \n\nMany studies have established the essential role of the  MAP kinase pathway in cellular transformation and cell  cycle regulation. Mutant oncogenic forms of upstream signaling components such as Ras, Raf-1, and G proteins  have been found in malignant cells (XREF_BIBR). Conversely, inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway blocks c-Ras-  and v-Mos-dependent cell transformation, and inhibits  cell growth, cell adhesion, and spreading (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Consistent with  some of these observations, in this study increased MAP  kinase activation induced by constitutively activated  MEK1 could partially rescue cell spreading; it had, however, no significant effects on cell growth (data not  shown). These findings indicate that the MAP kinase pathway is not the only pathway affected by PTEN.\n\nTwo substrates of PTEN have been identified recently,  focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and certain phosphoinositol  lipids (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).  The role of FAK in integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation is controversial (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), but it appears to be one of several possible pathways for enhancing  the binding of Grb2, leading to the formation of signaling  complexes that promote activation of the Ras signaling  pathway (XREF_BIBR). FAK is probably not,  however, an intermediary in EGF growth factor receptor  stimulation. In contrast to FAK, Shc is a more plausible effector for growth factor-mediated MAP kinase activation.  Several lines of evidence suggest that Shc-Grb2 association after growth factor or integrin stimulation is involved  in Ras activation (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). It will be interesting to investigate  the mechanisms by which PTEN inhibits Shc phosphorylation.\n\nRecently, it has been reported that PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3),  which is a product of phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI 3-kinase),  specifically at position 3 on the inositol ring (XREF_BIBR). However, EGF receptor signaling does  not appear to require PI 3-kinase activation (XREF_BIBR and data not shown), making it unlikely that the effects of PTEN on MAP kinase activation by this pathway  is via effects on phosphoinositides. Moreover, even though  PTEN inhibits MAP kinase activation by PDGF, it does  not affect PDGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt, a target  of PI 3-kinase. Integrin activation of inositol lipid signaling  appears to feed into the Ras/MAP kinase pathway at Raf  (XREF_BIBR). In the present study, however, expression of an upstream component, activated Ras, was sufficient to overcome the effect of PTEN on MAP kinase activation. Taken collectively, these findings suggest that the  effects of PTEN on MAP kinase signaling in these cells is  not via effects on phosphoinositides, but is instead through  effects on Ras signaling.\n\nPTEN consequently has complex but important effects  on signaling and cell biological processes. It can downmodulate Ras-mediated MAP kinase activation from integrins and growth factors (this study), phosphoinositide  signaling, FAK and p130 Cas  tyrosine phosphorylation,  Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Grb2 recruitment (this  study), focal adhesion and actin cytoskeletal organization,  cell proliferation, and cell migration (XREF_BIBR;  XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). These pleiotropic but selective effects are  probably due to specific actions of its phosphatase, since  the biological actions examined required an intact phosphatase domain. PTEN is thus a new regulator of a specific  subset of important cell biological functions. Overall, our  results suggest key sites of action of PTEN on (a) Shc and  its interaction with the adapter protein Grb2 and (b) focal  adhesion kinase.
