This ultimately prevents tumorigenesis (XREF_BIBR). In addition to its role in blocking tumorigenesis, p53 hampers malignant phenotypes such as tumor invasion and metastasis (XREF_BIBR). In some cases, even in the presence of wild-type TP53--the gene that encodes p53--transformation is induced when the ability of p53 to suppress tumorigenesis is somehow compromised. Mutations in TP53 are observed in ~50% of human cancers and frequently occur in late stages of a variety of cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancers (XREF_BIBR). Missense mutations in Ras oncogenes, resulting in their aberrant activation, are observed in ~30% of human cancers. Oncogenic Ras not only induces cellular transformation but also promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis (XREF_BIBR). Although much is known about the mechanism by which p53 prevents Ras transformation, less is known about how p53 suppresses Ras-driven invasion.\n\nIntegrins are essential for cell invasion, not only because they mediate adhesion to the ECM, but also because they initiate intracellular signals that regulate actin and adhesion dynamics (XREF_BIBR). Upon binding to the ECM, integrins recruit a large number of signaling proteins such as p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas) and FAK to form integrin adhesion complexes. p130Cas is a major substrate of Src at integrin adhesion complexes and Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas initiates Rac activation to promote lamellipodia formation (XREF_BIBR). Moreover, p130Cas confers an invasive phenotype in cancer cells (XREF_BIBR). The integrin adhesion complexes, of which p130Cas is a component, activate a range of Rho GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Rho GTPases drive changes in cell shape during cell movement by controlling actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction.\n\nHigh-temperature requirement A2 (HtrA2)/Omi is a serine protease and chaperone protein (XREF_BIBR) that has a mitochondrial targeting sequence and transmembrane domain in the N-terminal region. It is initially synthesized as a precursor protein with a predicted molecular weight of 49 kD. The mature 36-kD form of HtrA2/Omi is generated after its posttranslational translocation into mitochondria and subsequently resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). HtrA2/Omi maintains mitochondrial homeostasis including mitochondrial respiration; however, under stress conditions, HtrA2/Omi promotes apoptosis. In the presence of apoptotic stimuli, HtrA2/Omi is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, where it binds to and cleaves inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as X-IAP, and activates caspases. Overexpression of mature HtrA2/Omi also induces cell rounding through its protease activity (XREF_BIBR). This occurs without caspase activation. Proteomic analysis identified cytoskeletal proteins including beta-actin as substrates of HtrA2/Omi (XREF_BIBR), raising the possibility that the morphological change induced by HtrA2/Omi is due to proteolysis of cytoskeletal proteins.\n\nMitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo continuous cycles of fission and fusion (XREF_BIBR). Mitochondrial fission results from the constriction of mitochondria by the dynamin-related GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and mitochondrial fusion is mediated by other dynamin-related GTPases such as mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). This dynamic behavior enables daughter cells to inherit mitochondria after cell division and maintains the metabolic functions of mitochondria, including ATP synthesis. Furthermore, mitochondrial fission is often promoted during the early stages of apoptosis. This is commonly observed before caspase activation, and is known to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP; XREF_BIBR). MOMP leads to the release of IMS proteins such as cytochrome c and HtrA2/Omi into the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome c induces caspase activation and further promotes MOMP, resulting in a robust release of IMS proteins and apoptosis (XREF_BIBR). Mitochondrial dynamics therefore play an integral role in cell homeostasis, and indeed perturbation of the mitochondrial fission-fusion balance results in mitochondrial fragmentation, which is associated with many disease conditions (XREF_BIBR).\n\nOncogenic Ras promotes actin reorganization to promote cell invasion (XREF_BIBR). Concurrently, oncogenic Ras induces a p53-mediated alteration of the actin cytoskeleton via HtrA2/Omi, which hampers cell invasion. In this study, we show the opposing effects of oncogenic Ras on cell invasion. Ras-induced disruption of mitochondrial integrity is required for the p53-mediated suppression of cell invasion, and this reflects a novel role of p53 in suppressing the malignancy of transformed cells.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\np53 is involved in Ras-induced down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation.\n\nOncogenic Ras transforms immortal rodent cells expressing wild-type p53, as well as p53-deficient cells, but induces senescence or apoptosis in primary rodent cells expressing wild-type p53 (XREF_BIBR). To investigate the mechanism by which p53 prevents invasion of Ras-transformed cells, we transformed p53-deficient (p53 -/- ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), NIH3T3 cells, and immortalized wild-type MEFs (iMEFs) by introducing the activated form of Ha-Ras (Ha-RasV12). NIH3T3 cells and iMEFs are spontaneously immortalized MEFs and express wild-type p53. The invasiveness of Ras-transformed p53 -/-  MEFs into 3D matrices was higher than that of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells or iMEFs (XREF_FIG). The expression of a cancer-associated mutant p53 (p53R175H), which acts as a dominant-negative form, increased the invasiveness of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG). These results indicate that p53 prevents the invasiveness of Ras-transformed cells.\n\nReorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions (FAs) is commonly observed during cell transformation (XREF_BIBR). We therefore compared the actin architecture and FAs between the Ras-transformed cells. NIH3T3 cells and iMEFs, after transformation by oncogenic Ras, exhibited poorly spread morphologies             and decreased formation of actin stress fibers and FAs (XREF_FIG). However, in p53 -/-  MEFs, FA formation remained upon Ras transformation while actin stress fiber formation decreased. We then examined the status of FA proteins and showed that phosphorylation of p130Cas was reduced in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells and iMEFs, but not p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG). In contrast, all cells irrespective of p53 expression showed a slight decrease in the phosphorylation of FAK, which is another FA protein, upon Ras transformation (XREF_FIG). Furthermore, all cells showed an increase in the activity of Src, suggesting that the decreased phosphorylation of p130Cas is unlikely due to a down-regulation of Src activity. The expression of p53R175H restored both FA formation and p130Cas phosphorylation (XREF_FIG), which were decreased after oncogenic Ras transformation in NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG). These results show that p53 is involved in the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and FA formation after Ras transformation. Because p130Cas is known to promote cancer cell invasion (XREF_BIBR), we wondered whether p130Cas is involved in the enhanced invasiveness of Ras-transformed cells when wild-type p53 function is lost. We found that knockdown of p130Cas suppressed the invasion of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells expressing p53R175H (XREF_FIG) and the invasion of Ras-transformed p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG), suggesting that p53 suppresses Ras-driven invasion by down-regulating p130Cas phosphorylation.\n\n\n\np53 is required for HtrA2/Omi-mediated beta-actin cleavage after Ras transformation.\n\nPhosphorylation of FA proteins is affected by actin cytoskeleton dynamics (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Treatment of NIH3T3 cells with blebbistatin, a myosin II inhibitor, reduced phosphorylation of FAK, but did not affect phosphorylation of p130Cas (XREF_FIG). By contrast, when actin polymerization was inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin D or latrunculin A, phosphorylation of both p130Cas and FAK was diminished. These results suggest that the formation of F-actin is important for phosphorylation of p130Cas. We found that oncogenic Ras decreased the amount of F-actin and the ratio of F-actin to globular actin (G-actin) in NIH3T3 cells and iMEFs but not in p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG; Fig. S2 A). Introducing p53R175H increased the amount of F-actin and the F/G-actin ratio in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG; Fig. S2 B). Phosphorylation of p130Cas increased when F-actin was stabilized by treatment with jasplakinolide in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG). Collectively, these results suggest that p53 mediates the Ras-induced decrease in F-actin and thereby suppresses phosphorylation of p130Cas.\n\nWe found that oncogenic Ras induced the cleavage of beta-actin in NIH3T3 cells and iMEFs but not p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG). The cleavage of beta-actin in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells was diminished by expressing p53R175H (XREF_FIG). We therefore hypothesized that p53-dependent cleavage of beta-actin causes a decrease in the amount of F-actin and consequently decreases phosphorylation of p130Cas in Ras-transformed cells. Previous studies have shown that beta-actin is cleaved by the proteases caspase-3 and HtrA2/Omi, yielding fragments of ~30 kD from its C-terminal end (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, caspase-3 was unlikely to be involved in Ras-induced cleavage of beta-actin because oncogenic Ras did not significantly activate caspase-3 and treatment with the DNA-damaging agent Adriamycin activated caspase-3 but did not increase beta-actin cleavage in nontransformed cells            . We therefore examined whether HtrA2/Omi is involved in p53-dependent cleavage of beta-actin, which results in down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation upon Ras transformation. Knockdown of HtrA2/Omi did not affect phosphorylation of p130Cas in nontransformed cells (XREF_FIG). In contrast, knockdown of HtrA2/Omi restored down-regulated p130Cas phosphorylation induced by oncogenic Ras and diminished the cleavage of beta-actin (XREF_FIG). The HtrA2/Omi inhibitor Ucf-101 also diminished the cleavage of beta-actin and increased phosphorylation of p130Cas in Ras-transformed cells (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that HtrA2/Omi cleaves beta-actin after oncogenic Ras transformation.\n\nBecause cleavage of beta-actin seems to correlate with p130Cas phosphorylation, we wondered whether knockdown of HtrA2/Omi has an impact on F-actin and lamellipodia formation. Knockdown of HtrA2/Omi increased the amount of F-actin and the ratio of F/G-actin (XREF_FIG Fig. S2 C) and facilitated the formation of lamellipodia and FAs, but not stress fibers, in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG, I [middle], L, and M), as was the case with the introduction of p53R175H (XREF_FIG; XREF_FIG, middle). Taken together, these results suggest that, upon Ras transformation, HtrA2/Omi cleaves beta-actin in a p53-dependent manner and diminishes F-actin formation, resulting in down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation.\n\n\n\nHtrA2/Omi suppresses invasion of Ras-transformed cells.\n\nWe next examined role of HtrA2/Omi in the invasion of Ras-transformed cells. The invasiveness of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells was increased by knockdown of HtrA2/Omi (XREF_FIG, N [bottom] and O). This was abolished by knockdown of p130Cas (XREF_FIG), suggesting that HtrA2/Omi prevents Ras-driven invasion via down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation. Even though phosphorylation of p130Cas in nontransformed cells was higher than that in Ras-transformed cells (XREF_FIG), nontransformed NIH3T3 cells were not invasive (XREF_FIG, top) as previously reported (XREF_BIBR) and Ras-transformed cells invaded to a modest though significant extent (XREF_FIG, middle). Oncogenic Ras promotes cell invasion by increasing matrix degradation and migration regulated by multiple downstream molecules including Rho GTPases (XREF_BIBR). In this context, our results suggest that p130Cas has an integral role to play in Ras-driven invasion, though it is not the sole molecule responsible for this process.\n\nBecause the formation of lamellipodia, which are key structures for cancer cell invasion (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), is facilitated by p53R175H expression or HtrA2/Omi knockdown in Ras-transformed cells (XREF_FIG, middle; XREF_FIG [middle] and L), we next examined role of p130Cas in lamellipodia formation. We found that knockdown of p130Cas hampered lamellipodia formation in Ras-transformed cells with HtrA2/Omi knockdown and instead filopodia formation was promoted in these cells (XREF_FIG, middle; Videos 1-3), without any alteration in the amount of F-actin or the ratio of F/G-actin (XREF_FIG; Fig. S2, D and E). Similar effects of p130Cas knockdown were observed in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells expressing p53R175H (XREF_FIG; Videos 4 and 5). In addition, a decrease in the cell-spreading area upon oncogenic Ras transformation in a p53- or HtrA2/Omi-dependent manner was not affected by knockdown of p130Cas               . These results suggest that HtrA2/Omi decreases F-actin and hampers lamellipodia formation through down-regulation of p130Cas signaling, resulting in restricted Ras-driven invasion.\n\n\n\nOncogenic Ras induces the release of HtrA2/Omi from mitochondria into the cytosol by promoting mitochondrial fragmentation.\n\nGiven the cleavage of beta-actin by HtrA2/Omi, we hypothesized that the release of HtrA2/Omi into the cytosol is induced by oncogenic Ras. We found that the amount of HtrA2/Omi in the cytosolic fraction was increased upon Ras transformation in NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG). The release of IMS proteins, including HtrA2/Omi and cytochrome c, requires MOMP (XREF_BIBR). Unlike with MOMP induced by apoptotic stimuli, a robust release of cytochrome c was not observed in Ras-transformed cells regardless of the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh            . MOMP after activation of Ras may therefore be mechanistically different from that resulting from apoptotic stimuli. Because mitochondrial fission promotes MOMP (XREF_BIBR), we examined the effect of oncogenic Ras on mitochondrial morphology in NIH3T3 cells. In control cells, mitochondria were frequently observed as long, snake-like tubules whereas in Ras-transformed cells, mitochondria mostly appeared small and spherical (XREF_FIG). Overexpression of Mfn2 promotes mitochondria fusion and attenuated both the release of HtrA2/Omi from mitochondria and cleavage of beta-actin in Ras-transformed cells (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that oncogenic Ras promotes mitochondrial fission to induce the release of HtrA2/Omi into the cytosol.\n\n\n\np53 is involved in Ras-induced translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria and phosphorylation of HtrA2/Omi.\n\nOverexpression of p53 is known to induce the release of HtrA2/Omi from mitochondria (XREF_BIBR). However, in Ras-transformed p53 -/-  MEFs, mitochondria appeared small and spherical (XREF_FIG) and HtrA2/Omi was released from mitochondria into the cytosol (XREF_FIG, top), as was observed in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. These results indicate that p53 is not required for Ras-induced release of HtrA2/Omi.\n\nHtrA2/Omi is phosphorylated at Ser 142 by p38 MAPK, which increases the protease activity of HtrA2/Omi (XREF_BIBR). We then examined whether oncogenic Ras induces the activation of HtrA2/Omi in a p53-dependent manner. Oncogenic Ras increased phosphorylation of HtrA2/Omi at Ser 142 in NIH3T3 cells but not in p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG, top). Moreover, the increased phosphorylation in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells was diminished by expressing p53R175H (XREF_FIG, top). Collectively, these results indicate that p53 is required for activation of HtrA2/Omi induced by oncogenic Ras.\n\nMitochondrial serine/threonine protein kinase PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) has been shown to be essential for p38 MAPK-induced HtrA2/Omi phosphorylation (XREF_BIBR). Oncogenic Ras increased HtrA2/Omi phosphorylation in both the cytosol and mitochondria of NIH3T3 cells but not in p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG), whereas levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK--the active form of p38 MAPK--were comparable between NIH3T3 cells and p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG). We therefore hypothesized that oncogenic Ras induces the translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, we believed the subsequent phosphorylation of HtrA2/Omi occurred in mitochondria, before its release into the cytosol. In line with this, we found that in NIH3T3 cells but not p53 -/-  MEFs, oncogenic Ras increased the amount of p38 MAPK and its phosphorylated form in the mitochondrial fraction (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that oncogenic Ras induces phosphorylation of HtrA2/Omi by increasing the translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria in a p53-dependent manner. Consistent with this, p53R175H diminished Ras-induced phosphorylation of HtrA2/Omi in the mitochondrial fraction (XREF_FIG). Furthermore, we showed that treatment with BIRB796, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, diminished Ras-induced phosphorylation of HtrA2/Omi in mitochondria and cleavage of beta-actin (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that p53 mediates beta-actin cleavage via activation of HtrA2/Omi, which is induced by mitochondrial p38 MAPK after oncogenic Ras transformation.\n\nNext, we examined the direct effects of HtrA2/Omi on the cleavage of beta-actin. The exogenous mature form of HtrA2/Omi, which is diffusely distributed in cells (XREF_BIBR), increased the cleavage of beta-actin in Ras-transformed cells expressing p53R175H (XREF_FIG). The phosphomimetic mutant of mature HtrA2/Omi (mHtrA2/Omi-S142D) was more potent in cleaving beta-actin (XREF_FIG). To further examine whether HtrA2/Omi affects the stability of F-actin, we incubated fluorescently labeled F-actin with a purified mature form of HtrA2/Omi (XREF_FIG). Wild-type HtrA2/Omi induced disassembly of F-actin, with mHtrA2/Omi-S142D showing an even more prominent effect (XREF_FIG, C [left and right] and E; Videos 6 and 8). The protease-dead mutant of HtrA2/Omi (HtrA2/Omi-S306A) did not disassemble F-actin (XREF_FIG, C [middle] and E; Video 7), indicating that HtrA2/Omi-induced disassembly of F-actin depends on its protease activity. Because mHtrA2/Omi-S142D induced fragmentation of F-actin (XREF_FIG; Video 8), activated HtrA2/Omi is likely to cleave actin molecules in F-actin, thereby inducing its disassembly. Furthermore, we showed that mHtrA2/Omi-S142D abolished the invasiveness of Ras-transformed p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG). These results support the notion that invasion of Ras-transformed cells is attenuated by the cleavage of beta-actin through activation of HtrA2/Omi.\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that p53 mediates Ras-induced translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria and induces activation of HtrA2/Omi, resulting in down-regulation of p130Cas signaling via the disassembly of F-actin.\n\n\n\nCytoplasmic p53 promotes the translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria.\n\nWe next investigated the mechanism by which p53 mediates Ras-induced translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria. Several studies show that p38 MAPK is present in mitochondria under stress conditions (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). It is known that p53 mediates a stress-induced reduction of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), which is usually generated by the respiratory chain. We therefore examined DeltaPsim using JC-1. Cancer cells exhibit decreased oxidative phosphorylation, but maintain DeltaPsim (XREF_BIBR). Consistent with this, DeltaPsim in most mitochondria was maintained in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG). However, DeltaPsim in mitochondria at the cell periphery was decreased and this decrease was blocked by expressing p53R175H and abolished in p53 -/-  MEFs, indicating that oncogenic Ras decreases DeltaPsim in a subset of mitochondria within a cell in a p53-dependent manner. We showed that treatment with CCCP, which uncouples the proton gradient and dissipates DeltaPsim, promoted the translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria in Ras-transformed p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that p53 mediates Ras-induced translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria by decreasing DeltaPsim.\n\nIt is well known that p53 induces MOMP by inducing expression of its target genes, such as PUMA and BAX, resulting in a loss of DeltaPsim (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Oncogenic Ras did not increase the expression of PUMA and BAX in both NIH3T3 cells and in p53 -/-  MEFs                   , suggesting that the decrease in DeltaPsim induced by oncogenic Ras may not be dependent on transactivation of p53 targets. In addition to its role as a transcription factor in the nucleus, p53 has functions in the cytoplasm (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Under stress conditions, p53 translocates to mitochondria, contributing to the decrease in DeltaPsim. We found that p53 accumulated at mitochondria and in the cytosol in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (XREF_FIG). We then addressed whether cytoplasmic p53 is involved in the translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria after Ras transformation. In Ras-transformed p53 -/-  MEFs, the nuclear localization signal (NLS) mutant of p53 (p53KRKKK) localized at mitochondria and in the cytosol and enhanced the translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria (XREF_FIG), without the induction of PUMA and BAX expression            . p53KRKKK increased phosphorylation of HtrA2/Omi in mitochondria and decreased the invasion of Ras-transformed p53 -/-  MEFs (XREF_FIG). Altogether, these results suggest that cytoplasmic p53 restricts Ras-induced cell invasion through increasing p38 MAPK-induced HtrA2/Omi activation in mitochondria.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nWe have revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which p53 suppresses Ras-driven invasion (XREF_FIG). Upon Ras transformation, accumulation of p53 in the cytoplasm is induced, resulting in the activation of HtrA2/Omi via an increased translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria. Concurrently, oncogenic Ras induces mitochondrial fragmentation regardless of p53 expression. As a result, activated HtrA2/Omi is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, where it induces F-actin disassembly. This leads to a down-regulation of p130Cas signaling, thereby suppressing cell invasion through the impairment of lamellipodia formation. This p53-mediated pathway will play an important role in the suppression of malignancy when tumorigenesis is induced by oncogenic Ras.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction induced by small molecule drugs including the F 0  proton channel inhibitor oligomycin triggers mitochondrial fragmentation without cell death                       . In addition, treatment with oligomycin induces the release of HtrA2/Omi from mitochondria            . Because Ras transformation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction (XREF_BIBR), it is likely that oncogenic Ras induces HtrA2/Omi release through mitochondrial fragmentation caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nMembers of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family, including Bax and Bak, are major activators of MOMP and apoptosis (XREF_BIBR). After apoptotic stimuli, Bax is recruited from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where Bak is already present. Oligomerization of the two proteins promotes MOMP, leading to caspase activation, which follows the release of IMS proteins involving HtrA2/Omi. Oncogenic Ras induces the release of HtrA2/Omi without caspase activation (XREF_FIG; Fig. S3), implying that MOMP after Ras transformation is mechanistically different from MOMP induced by apoptotic stimuli. Bax shuttles between the cytosol and mitochondrial fission sites and oligomerizes at the fission sites to induce MOMP (XREF_BIBR). GFP-tagged Bax (GFP-Bax) was diffusely distributed in nontransformed cells            , in line with a previous study (XREF_BIBR), whereas it clearly localized to mitochondria in Ras-transformed cells or oligomycin-treated cells                   . Bak is constitutively down-regulated by oncogenic Ras (XREF_BIBR). This suggests that oncogenic Ras-induced MOMP and HtrA2/Omi release involves Bax, but not Bak, and that oncogenic Ras functions to suppress Bax/Bak-induced MOMP after apoptotic stimuli. Indeed, oncogenic Ras suppresses ECM detachment-induced anoikis, a form of apoptosis, via inhibition of HtrA2/Omi release, which is mediated by Bax and Bak (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Thus, oncogenic Ras controls the release of HtrA2/Omi through the regulation of a different type of MOMP.\n\nOur results suggest that the mitochondrial translocation of p38 MAPK, which is induced by cytoplasmic p53 to activate HtrA2/Omi, is caused by a decrease in DeltaPsim (XREF_FIG). This decrease in DeltaPsim is dispensable for HtrA2/Omi release from mitochondria                   . In response to stress signals, p53 is known to rapidly translocate to mitochondria and decrease in DeltaPsim (XREF_BIBR). When p53 accumulates in the mitochondrial outer membrane, p53 binds to Bcl-2 family members and promotes Bax/Bak-induced MOMP. This will not occur after Ras transformation because neither the release of cytochrome c nor activation of caspase is observed in Ras-transformed cells          . p53 also accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix, thereby inhibiting cyclophilin D, which is a regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), and triggering the opening of MPTP (XREF_BIBR). A decrease in DeltaPsim was observed in mitochondria at the cell periphery in Ras-transformed cells expressing p53 (XREF_FIG). The subcellular heterogeneity of DeltaPsim is usually due to mitochondria interacting with other organelles, including the ER and acidic vesicular organelles (XREF_BIBR). p53 is also known to localize at the ER or lysosome (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Cytoplasmic p53 seems to contribute to the decrease in DeltaPsim by modulating these interactions in Ras-transformed cells. In addition, cytosolic p53 is known to inhibit the autophagic elimination of depolarized mitochondria (XREF_BIBR) and may facilitate the accumulation of mitochondria with low DeltaPsim in Ras-transformed cells.\n\nThe cleavage of beta-actin after Ras transformation was observed in both NIH3T3 cells and iMEFs expressing wild-type p53 (XREF_FIG). The amount of beta-actin cleavage in NIH3T3 cells is higher than that in iMEFs and this is correlated with a decrease in the F-actin amount; however, the decrease in F/G-actin ratio was comparable between NIH3T3 cells and iMEFs (XREF_FIG). Because HtrA2/Omi cleaves nonpolymerized actin (XREF_BIBR) as well as polymerized actin (XREF_FIG), changes in the F-actin to G-actin ratio after Ras transformation appears to be associated with a decrease in not only F-actin, but also G-actin. As actin filament formation plays an important role in p130Cas phosphorylation, correlation between decreased p130Cas phosphorylation and the amount of F-actin, rather than the F-actin to G-actin ratio, is reasonable. Because immortal cells have genes with mutations, this may influence the cleavage of beta-actin in response to oncogenic Ras. However, results using primary p53 -/-  MEFs or p53R175H-introduced NIH3T3 cells support our provided model that p53 hampers Ras-driven invasion via HtrA2/Omi-mediated cleavage of beta-actin when the ability of p53 to suppress tumorigenesis is somehow compromised.\n\np130Cas and FAK are localized at FAs and cooperate to promote cancer cell invasion (XREF_BIBR). Increase in cellular tension is known to induce activation of FAK, which subsequently induces autophosphorylation at Tyr397, leading to the recruitment of various proteins to FAs, including p130Cas (XREF_BIBR). Interestingly, their regulation in Ras-transformed cells appears to be different. FAK phosphorylation was slightly decreased in Ras-transformed cells irrespective of p53 expression, whereas p130Cas phosphorylation was decreased only in Ras-transformed cells expressing p53 (XREF_FIG). Phosphorylation of both FAK and p130Cas was significantly decreased by the inhibition of actin polymerization in nontransformed cells (XREF_FIG). Importantly, the amount of F-actin in p53 -/-  MEFs was not affected by transformation (XREF_FIG) and therefore oncogenic Ras-mediated down-regulation of FAK phosphorylation is not caused by the inhibition of actin polymerization. A Ras-induced reduction in traction force exertion, which is associated with actomyosin contractility (XREF_BIBR), was observed in both NIH3T3 cells and p53 -/-  MEFs                   , and may therefore, at least in part, be involved in the decrease in FAK phosphorylation. In addition, FAK phosphorylation is regulated independently of focal adhesion regulation (XREF_BIBR). Taken together, p130Cas promotes cell invasion of Ras-transformed cells, without a correlation in FAK activity.\n\nHere, we propose a novel role of p53 in dictating the malignant phenotype of oncogenic Ras-transformed cells. The evidence presented in this study highlights the importance of p53 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton via disruption of mitochondrial integrity.\n\n\n\n","sentences":[{"words":["p53","mediated","activation","of","the","mitochondrial","protease","HtrA2","and","Omi","prevents","cell","invasion","."],"startOffsets":[0,4,13,24,27,31,45,54,59,60,64,73,78,86],"endOffsets":[3,12,23,26,30,44,53,59,60,63,72,77,86,87],"tags":["NN","VBD","NN","IN","DT","JJ","NN","NN","CC","NN","VBZ","NN","NN","."],"lemmas":["p53","mediate","activation","of","the","mitochondrial","protease","htra2","and","omus","prevent","cell","invasion","."],"entities":["B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","B-BioProcess","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","B-VP","B-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":1,"destination":10,"relation":"ccomp"},{"source":2,"destination":3,"relation":"prep"},{"source":3,"destination":7,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":7,"destination":4,"relation":"det"},{"source":7,"destination":5,"relation":"amod"},{"source":7,"destination":6,"relation":"nn"},{"source":7,"destination":8,"relation":"cc"},{"source":7,"destination":9,"relation":"conj"},{"source":10,"destination":2,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":10,"destination":12,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":12,"destination":11,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[1]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":1,"destination":10,"relation":"ccomp"},{"source":2,"destination":7,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":2,"destination":9,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":7,"destination":4,"relation":"det"},{"source":7,"destination":5,"relation":"amod"},{"source":7,"destination":6,"relation":"nn"},{"source":7,"destination":9,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":10,"destination":2,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":10,"destination":12,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":12,"destination":11,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[1]}}},{"words":["The","tumor","suppressor","p53","induces","activation","of","the","mitochondrial","protease","HtrA2","and","Omi","and","prevents","Ras","driven","invasion","by","modulating","the","actin","cytoskeleton","."],"startOffsets":[91,95,101,112,116,124,135,138,142,156,165,170,171,175,179,188,192,199,208,211,222,226,232,244],"endOffsets":[94,100,111,115,123,134,137,141,155,164,170,171,174,178,187,191,198,207,210,221,225,231,244,245],"tags":["DT","NN","NN","NN","VBZ","NN","IN","DT","JJ","NN","NN","CC","NN","CC","VBZ","NN","VBN","NN","IN","VBG","DT","NN","NN","."],"lemmas":["the","tumor","suppressor","p53","induce","activation","of","the","mitochondrial","protease","htra2","and","omus","and","prevent","ra","drive","invasion","by","modulate","the","actin","cytoskeleton","."],"entities":["O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","I-Gene_or_gene_product","I-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","B-Family","O","B-BioProcess","O","O","O","B-Cellular_component","I-Cellular_component","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-VP","B-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":3,"destination":0,"relation":"det"},{"source":3,"destination":1,"relation":"nn"},{"source":3,"destination":2,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":4,"destination":5,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":4,"destination":13,"relation":"cc"},{"source":4,"destination":14,"relation":"conj"},{"source":5,"destination":6,"relation":"prep"},{"source":6,"destination":10,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":10,"destination":7,"relation":"det"},{"source":10,"destination":8,"relation":"amod"},{"source":10,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"},{"source":10,"destination":11,"relation":"cc"},{"source":10,"destination":12,"relation":"conj"},{"source":14,"destination":15,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":15,"destination":16,"relation":"vmod"},{"source":16,"destination":17,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":16,"destination":18,"relation":"prep"},{"source":18,"destination":19,"relation":"pcomp"},{"source":19,"destination":22,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":22,"destination":20,"relation":"det"},{"source":22,"destination":21,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[4]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":3,"destination":0,"relation":"det"},{"source":3,"destination":1,"relation":"nn"},{"source":3,"destination":2,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":4,"destination":5,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":4,"destination":14,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":5,"destination":10,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":5,"destination":12,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":10,"destination":7,"relation":"det"},{"source":10,"destination":8,"relation":"amod"},{"source":10,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"},{"source":10,"destination":12,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":14,"destination":15,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":14,"destination":3,"relation"
