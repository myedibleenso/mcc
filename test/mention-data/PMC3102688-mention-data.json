      "text":"p21 WAF1/CIP1  Upregulation through the Stress Granule-Associated Protein CUGBP1 Confers Resistance to Bortezomib-Mediated Apoptosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground.\n\np21 WAF1/CIP1  is a well known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor induced by various stress stimuli. Depending on the stress applied, p21 upregulation can either promote apoptosis or prevent against apoptotic injury. The stress-mediated induction of p21 involves not only its transcriptional activation but also its posttranscriptional regulation, mainly through stabilization of p21 mRNA levels. We have previously reported that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 induces the stabilization of p21 mRNA, which correlates with the formation of cytoplasmic RNA stress granules. The mechanism underlying p21 mRNA stabilization, however, remains unknown.\n\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings.\n\nWe identified the stress granules component CUGBP1 as a factor required for p21 mRNA stabilization following treatment with bortezomib (= PS-341/Velcade). This peptide boronate inhibitor of the 26S proteasome is very efficient for the treatment of myelomas and other hematological tumors. However, solid tumors are sometimes refractory to bortezomib treatment. We found that depleting CUGBP1 in cancer cells prevents bortezomib-mediated p21 upregulation. FISH experiments combined to mRNA stability assays show that this effect is largely due to a mistargeting of p21 mRNA in stress granules leading to its degradation. Altering the expression of p21 itself, either by depleting CUGBP1 or p21, promotes bortezomib-mediated apoptosis.\n\n\n\nConclusions/Significance.\n\nWe propose that one key mechanism by which apoptosis is inhibited upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs might involve upregulation of the p21 protein through CUGBP1.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe proteasome is a large multi-subunit complex responsible for the degradation of various proteins, including cell cycle regulators and apoptotic factors, via both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent mechanisms  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Incubation of proliferating cells with proteasome inhibitors induces apoptosis  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has recently been approved for clinical use, showing strong antitumor activity in multiple myeloma and other hematological tumors  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . However, solid tumors of different organ origins are refractory to bortezomib, and this resistance is also observed in cancer cell lines derived from solid tumors  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . The mechanisms by which cancer cells resist to bortezomib are still largely unknown, although it is postulated that this resistance might involve the activation of a general stress response  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR .\n\nWe have recently reported the formation of stress granules following treatment with bortezomib  XREF_BIBR . Stress granules (SG) are cytoplasmic bodies whose formation is induced by various types of stress such as ionizing radiations  XREF_BIBR , hypoxia  XREF_BIBR , viral infection  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , and proteasome inhibitors  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Since such stress stimuli are known to inhibit translation initiation, it was speculated that SG represent sites where the translation of specific mRNAs is repressed  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . SG might repress translation in part by limiting the interaction of mRNAs with ribosomes  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . The potential role of SG in translation repression is supported by several reports showing that specific mRNAs are inefficiently repressed when RNA-binding proteins, which contribute to SG formation, are altered  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . These foci also contain small ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors and signaling molecules  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . In accordance with the proposed role of SG as storage sites for untranslated mRNAs, these foci are devoid of large ribosomal subunits  XREF_BIBR . Once the stress is relieved SG gradually disassemble, leading to the recovery of translation required for cell survival. It is thus postulated that SG formation is central to the stress response, which reprograms gene expression towards the synthesis of proteins that are essential to allow cells to cope with stress and thus survive  XREF_BIBR . Indeed, the induction of SG upon exposure to hypoxia  XREF_BIBR , oxidative stress (e.g. arsenite)  XREF_BIBR , or bortezomib treatment  XREF_BIBR  leads to resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis. One mechanism underlying such resistance appears to involve the sequestration and inactivation of pro-apoptotic factors such as RACK1 and TRAF2 in SG  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Other mechanisms by which SG may antagonize apoptosis could involve the sequestration of mRNA encoding key anti-apoptotic factors within SG, thereby preventing their degradation. Although such mechanisms have not been formally demonstrated, evidence nevertheless exists suggesting a role for SG in the regulation of mRNAs encoding anti-apoptotic proteins  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR .\n\nWe and others have previously suggested a potential role of SG in the regulation of one such antiapoptotic factor, namely the expression of p21 WAF1/CIP1  mRNA  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . p21 is a well-known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor induced following various stress stimuli, including proteasome inhibitors. As a proliferation inhibitor, p21 was suggested to play a role in tumor suppression by promoting cell cycle arrest or by inducing apoptosis  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Conversely, other laboratories reported that stress-induced upregulation of p21 can protect tumor cells from apoptosis  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Whether p21 upregulation promotes resistance to apoptosis mediated by proteasome inhibitors in cancer cells is currently unknown. It is well established that stress-mediated upregulation of p21 involves transcriptional mechanisms. Other studies indicate that p21 expression is also regulated post-transcriptionally, mainly at the level of mRNA stability, in response to various SG-inducing stress stimuli such as UV radiation  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  and oxidative stress  XREF_BIBR . We have previously shown that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 induces the sequestration of p21 mRNA into SG, which correlates with its stabilization  XREF_BIBR .\n\nDue to its short half-life, p21 mRNA is expressed at very low levels under normal growth conditions  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . We showed that treatment of HeLa cells for 3 to 6 h with proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 or lactacystin induces both SG formation and p21 mRNA accumulation, due in part to stabilization of the latter  XREF_BIBR .\n\nCUGBP1 belongs to the CELF family of RNA binding proteins and is aberrantly expressed in myotonic dystrophy type I  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . CUGBP1 controls mRNA splicing in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, CUGBP1 was shown to promote either mRNA decay  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR  or translation of its associated mRNAs  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . The translational function of CUGBP1 has been investigated in normal cells. These studies showed that CUGBP1 increases p21 translation in myocytes, thereby leading to their differentiation  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , and in aged normal fibroblasts, where it results in a senescent-like phenotype  XREF_BIBR . The role of CUGBP1 in apoptosis was unsuspected until recently. Kress and coll. generated mice in which the Cugbp1 gene was inactivated by homologous recombination  XREF_BIBR . Although Cugbp1 -/-  mice are viable, they display significant perinatal mortality and growth retardation. Moreover, germ cells derived from Cugbp1 -/-  mice are more prone to apoptosis than wild-type cells  XREF_BIBR . Recent studies have shown that CUGBP1 accumulates into SG following arsenite treatment, indicating that CUGBP1 might play a role in cellular stress response  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR .\n\nIn the study herein, we identified CUGBP1 as a factor required for p21 mRNA stabilization upon bortezomib treatment. We show here that CUGBP1 accumulates into SG following bortezomib treatment, together with its associated p21 mRNA. Upon depletion of CUGBP1, bortezomib-mediated p21 mRNA localization in SG and therefore its stabilization are lost, thereby leading to its misexpression. Altering the expression of p21 either by depleting CUGBP1 or p21 itself promotes bortezomib-mediated apoptosis. Our study unveils p21 as a potential therapeutic target.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nBortezomib induces p21 mRNA accumulation followed by its translation.\n\nWe have previously shown that bortezomib induces the reversible formation of SG  XREF_BIBR . We therefore analyzed the expression of p21 during the assembly and disassembly of SG following bortezomib addition. In HeLa cells, SG formation, which occurred 4 h after bortezomib treatment ( XREF_FIG ; center panel) correlated with a drastic increase in the steady-state level of p21 mRNA ( XREF_FIG ). Time course analysis of SG formation shows that the percentage of cells forming SG remains high between 4 and 7 h of bortezomib treatment. ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). At those stages, however, p21 mRNA was not being efficiently translated ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), despite its sustained accumulation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Prolonged treatment with bortezomib (10 h) resulted in complete SG disassembly ( XREF_FIG ; bottom panel, and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) and concomitant efficient p21 protein production ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), despite some reduction (30-40%) in p21 mRNA level ( XREF_FIG ). We obtained similar results using two other cell lines, namely the MCF-7 human breast carcinoma and Calu-I human lung carcinoma cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). We next used immunofluorescence to corroborate our results of p21 expression. We found that p21 was below the detection threshold in untreated cells or upon treatment with bortezomib for 4 h ( XREF_FIG ; top and center panels, respectively, and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) to 7 h ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Very few (<5%) untreated cells or cells treated with bortezomib for 4-7 h did express p21, however, which might either reflect a stressed state or normal cell cycle arrest in these cells. However, when bortezomib treatment was extended to 10 h, p21 was highly expressed and accumulated in the nucleus, concomitantly with SG disassembly ( XREF_FIG ; bottom panel; see also  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). To ensure that the proteasome is still inhibited at the time when SG disassembled, we monitored the expression of a reporter GFP fused to a proteasome-targeting sequence (GFPu). In the absence of any proteasome inhibitors, the GFPu protein is constitutively degraded by the proteasome  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Treatment of these GFPu-expressing cells with bortezomib prevented the degradation of GFPu protein, which accumulated. This accumulation of GFPu persists even after prolonged treatment with bortezomib for 10 h and beyond ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  and data not shown), indicating that the activity of the proteasome was not recovered. Moreover, prolonged treatment (10 h and beyond) with bortezomib resulted also in the accumulation of proteasome substrates such as p27  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR  ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  and data not shown) and p53  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR  (data not shown). These results indicate that the disassembly of SG occurred without reactivation of the proteasome. Nuclear p21 has previously been shown to promote cell cycle arrest, mainly by interfering with cyclin E/cdk2 activity  XREF_BIBR . On the other hand, other studies have reported that nuclear p21 accumulation promotes the formation of cyclin D-cdk4 complexes in cancer cells, thus contributing to increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis in tumors  XREF_BIBR . Therefore, we investigated whether nuclear p21 accumulation which occurred concomitantly with SG disassembly (cf. 10 h following bortezomib treatment;  XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) might reflect cell cycle arrest. Time course-FACS analysis of cell cycle progression shows that bortezomib treatment does not affect cell cycle ( XREF_FIG ). As a control for cell cycle arrest we used nocodazole  XREF_BIBR , which as shown in  XREF_FIG  stops cellular progression at G2/M. p21 was also shown to inhibit apoptosis through inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and caspase-3 in the cytoplasm  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . We found that protracted treatment with bortezomib (16 h) induces a significant accumulation of p21 in the cytoplasm ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ; bottom-right panel; see also  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), which may reflect a role of this protein in antagonizing bortezomib-mediated apoptosis (see below). Overall, the results thus far show that bortezomib-mediated p21 upregulation involves two steps: (i) the initial accumulation of p21 mRNA, which correlates with SG formation, and (ii) the secondary translation of p21 mRNA, which correlates with SG disassembly. This pattern of events suggests that SG might serve as foci for the accumulation of p21 mRNA in a translationally repressed form.\n\n\n\nBortezomib treatment induces p21 mRNA segregation with SG and its stabilization.\n\nWe next assessed whether accumulating p21 mRNA was localized in bortezomib-induced SG. For that purpose, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize p21 mRNA in fixed HeLa cells, using fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  as a marker for staining SG ( XREF_FIG ). Resulting staining reflected a typical localization of FMRP in the cytoplasm in control experiments ( XREF_FIG , panels 8 and 11), and in SG upon bortezomib treatment ( XREF_FIG , panels 2 and 5). FISH showed a barely detectable p21 mRNA staining in untreated cells ( XREF_FIG , panel 7; see also  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), in keeping with the low amount of p21 mRNA and protein observed under normal growth conditions (cf.  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Bortezomib induced the localization of p21 mRNA in SG in a high percentage (~80%) of cells, as assessed by FISH using the targeted (antisense) probe ( XREF_FIG , panels 1 and 3; see also  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Quantification of the intensity of p21 mRNA FISH signal in SG compared to the cytoplasm revealed that the major fraction (~80%) of p21 mRNA was associated with SG ( XREF_FIG ; left panel; see also  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Background FISH signal was detected in SG and in the cytoplasm using the untargeted (sense) probe ( XREF_FIG , panels 4 and 6, and  XREF_FIG ; center and right panels). Similar background signal was detected in the cytoplasm of bortezomib-treated cells using the antisense probe ( XREF_FIG , panels 1 and 3; see also the right panel of  XREF_FIG  for quantification), as compared to the signal obtained using the sense probe ( XREF_FIG , panels 4 and 6, and the right panel of  XREF_FIG ). The SG-linked FISH signal which is detected using antisense probe was specific to p21 mRNA since it was lost in cells treated with p21-targeted siRNA to deplete the transcript ( XREF_FIG ; compare panels 1 and 4, and  XREF_FIG ). p21 depletion it self did not affect SG formation, as suggested by the localization of several SG markers ( XREF_FIG , and data not shown) ruling out the possibility that the loss of SG-linked FISH signal observed in p21-depleted cells was due to a general cellular failure to form SG. As expected, prolonged treatment (10 h) of cells with bortezomib induces SG disassembly and p21 mRNA localization to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ; bottom-left panels). At this time, however, the overall p21 mRNA FISH signal is weaker than the one observed in cells treated with bortezomib for 4 h ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ; compare bottom-left with center-left panel), in keeping with the decreased amount of p21 mRNA as measured by qRT-PCR following SG disassembly ( XREF_FIG ). Overall, the results ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) show that p21 mRNA is quantitatively recruited to bortezomib-induced SG. We then assessed the possible contribution of p21 mRNA localization in SG in its accumulation. We have previously reported that the formation of bortezomib-induced SG requires heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI)  XREF_BIBR . Thus, we examined whether altering SG formation via HRI depletion affects p21 mRNA accumulation. We found that HRI depletion indeed prevented p21 mRNA accumulation following bortezomib treatment, as assessed by qRT-PCR ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). HRI was efficiently depleted as assessed by western blotting ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), and as expected, its depletion completely prevented SG formation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Altogether, these results show that bortezomib treatment induces p21 mRNA accumulation in SG. We then addressed the hypothesis that this p21 mRNA accumulation reflects its stabilization. For this purpose, we determined the effect of bortezomib on p21 mRNA stability in the presence of actinomycin D. Upon inhibition of de novo RNA synthesis with actinomycin D, the relative half-life of p21 mRNA was increased from 60 min +/-10 min in untreated cells to >3 h upon bortezomib treatment ( XREF_FIG ), reflecting bortezomib-induced accumulation of p21 mRNA ( XREF_FIG ). As shown in  XREF_FIG  however, the p21 mRNA decay included a plateau phase. This indicated that the p21 mRNA decay may not be a first order process. This type of decay occurs if two or more degradation processes with different rate constants are involved. Subpopulation of p21 mRNAs may be restricted to discrete subcellular locations that prevent their decay. Also, the decay of some p21 mRNAs may be mediated by competing pathways and/or decay mechanisms utilizing distinct trans-acting complexes, which could then affect their decay rates. Nevertheless, our results suggest that p21 mRNA segregation in SG contributes to its stabilization and accumulation upon bortezomib treatment. Next we sought to determine which factor is involved in p21 mRNA localization in SG.\n\n\n\nRole of CUGBP1 in p21 mRNA accumulation and subsequent translation during bortezomib treatment.\n\nThe SG components HuR and CUGBP1 have been shown to bind p21 mRNA, thereby regulating its expression  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . While HuR promotes p21 mRNA stabilization through interaction with its AU-rich element in the 3'-untranslated region, CUGBP1 interacts with the GC-rich element in the 5' region of p21 mRNA coding sequence and promotes its translation in senescent fibroblast cells. We investigated the role of these two proteins in the upregulation of p21 WAF/CIP1  observed upon proteasome inhibition in HeLa cells. We found that depletion of HuR had no effect or rather slightly increased p21 protein expression following bortezomib treatment (data not shown). Depletion of CUGBP1 using two specific siRNAs had no effect on p21 protein expression under normal growth conditions but prevented bortezomib-mediated p21 WAF/CIP1  upregulation as assessed by western blot analysis using anti-p21 antibodies ( XREF_FIG  and data not shown). These results indicate that CUGBP1 promotes p21 upregulation upon proteasome inhibition. As a first step to investigate how CUGBP1 up-regulates p21 upon proteasome inhibition, we performed co- localization studies between CUGBP1 and p21 mRNA. Under normal growth conditions, CUGBP1 is mostly nuclear  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY , panel 2). Arsenite induces the localization of a fraction of CUGBP1 in SG  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , and our immunofluorescence experiments showed that CUGBP1 was also recruited into bortezomib-induced SG ( XREF_FIG ). Quantification of these immunofluorescence data show that a significant fraction (~45%) of total CUGBP1 is present in SG ( XREF_FIG ) where it co-localized with p21 mRNA ( XREF_FIG ) following treatment with bortezomib. Under these conditions, about 50% of CUGBP1 is nuclear ( XREF_FIG ) and only residual staining of CUGBP1 is detected in the cytoplasm ( XREF_FIG ). Prolonged treatment with bortezomib (10 h) resulted however in nuclear localization of most CUGBP1 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). At this time we detected also some p21 mRNA FISH signal in the nucleus. However, and as mentioned above, the overall p21 mRNA FISH signal at 10-h bortezomib treatment is reduced ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), as compared to 4 h treatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ; see also  XREF_FIG ) at which time point most of p21 mRNA (~80%) co-localized with CUGBP1 in SG ( XREF_FIG ). Overall, our results ( XREF_FIG ) indicate that bortezomib treatment induces CUGBP1-p21 mRNA co-localization in SG. CUGBP1 might thus bind to p21 mRNA and recruit it to SG where it accumulates. The latter assumption would therefore predict that CUGBP1 depletion should trigger p21 mRNA degradation, which would explain the low amount of p21 protein following prolonged proteasome inhibition in CUGBP1-depleted cells ( XREF_FIG ). Indeed, we first confirmed that CUGBP1 binds to p21 mRNA under bortezomib conditions, as assessed by immunoprecipitating CUGBP1 ( XREF_FIG ) followed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to detect associated p21 mRNA ( XREF_FIG ). This binding was specific, as suggested by the finding that control p27 mRNA was not recovered in CUGBP1 immunoprecipitates ( XREF_FIG ). Second, the steady-state p21 mRNA level significantly decreased in CUGBP1-depleted cells following proteasome inhibition ( XREF_FIG ). Depletion of CUGBP1 had however no effect on the steady-state level of p21 mRNA in untreated cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), suggesting that CUGBP1 is not required to maintain the basal level of the p21 mRNA. We then tested the possibility that the decreased level of p21 mRNA in CUGBP1-depleted cells upon bortezomib treatment might be consistent with a more rapid degradation of p21 mRNA. Indeed, the half-life of p21 mRNA in bortezomib conditions decreased from >3 h in mock-depleted cells ( XREF_FIG ) to 90 min +/-15 min in CUGBP1-depleted cells ( XREF_FIG ). Depletion of CUGBP1 was efficient, as evidenced by both western blot analysis ( XREF_FIG ) and immunofluorescence ( XREF_FIG ), using anti-CUGBP1 antibodies. However, quantification of the localization of several SG markers ( XREF_FIG , and data not shown) indicated that CUGBP1 depletion per se did not affect SG formation. This result ruled out the possibility that the destabilization of p21 mRNA observed in CUGBP1-depleted cells upon bortezomib treatment ( XREF_FIG ) was due to a cellular failure to form SG. One likely possibility of the destabilisation of p21 mRNA observed in CUGBP1-depleted cells is because it is no longer recruited to SG. We then assessed if CUGBP1 depletion affects the accumulation of p21 mRNA in SG using FISH. SG were visualized by immunofluorescence using antibodies to either Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 G3BP1 ( XREF_FIG ) or FXR1 (data not shown). Whereas the major fraction of p21 mRNA (~70%) is present in SG in over 60% of mock-depleted cells upon treatment with bortezomib ( XREF_FIG ), less than 30% of CUGBP1-depleted cells only exhibited such p21 mRNA localization in SG ( XREF_FIG ). Indeed, the large fraction of CUGBP1-depleted cells (~80%) has a barely detectable FISH p21 mRNA signal in SG and in the cytoplasm ( XREF_FIG ). Under those bortezomib conditions, quantification of the intensity of p21 mRNA FISH signal showed that CUGBP1 depletion decreased this signal to 30-40%, as compared to mock-depleted cells where most p21 mRNA FISH signal was detected in SG ( XREF_FIG ). This effect seems to be specific since under the same conditions, depletion of CUGBP1 does not affect the association of the non-target GAPDH mRNA  XREF_BIBR  with SG as assessed by immunofluorescence coupled with FISH ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Overall, our results show that CUGBP1 depletion significantly prevented bortezomib-induced p21 mRNA accumulation, which is likely due to its mistargeting in SG. As aforementioned, CUGBP1 depletion does not affect p21 mRNA steady-state levels in normal growth conditions ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) and we found that this is also the case under staurosporine treatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), a SG-free apoptotic condition  XREF_BIBR  ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest that CUGBP1 is not required to maintain the steady-state levels of p21 mRNA in the cytoplasm. On contrary, CUGBP1 seems to be required for bortezomib-induced p21 mRNA accumulation in SG ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_FIG 6C). We suggest that CUGBP1 promotes p21 mRNA accumulation by recruiting the transcript in SG, although we do not exclude that CUGBP1-mediated p21 mRNA accumulation involves additional mechanisms. Nevertheless, these results showed that CUGBP1 acts as a positive effector of p21 upregulation upon proteasome inhibition.\n\n\n\np21 upregulation prevents bortezomib-mediated cell death.\n\nHaving revealed CUGBP1-mediated p21 mRNA accumulation as a pathway that promotes p21 upregulation following bortezomib treatment, we then investigated whether targeting this pathway might induce apoptosis. We have previously shown that suppressing SG formation induces massive apoptosis following bortezomib treatment  XREF_BIBR . We thus tested the effect of a decreased p21 WAF/CIP1  expression on apoptosis upon bortezomib treatment. HeLa cells treated with p21-specific or control siRNAs were exposed to bortezomib (2 microM) for 16 h, and apoptosis was then measured (i) by western blot analysis of the cleavage of caspase-3, one of the main effectors of caspase-dependent apoptosis, as well as (ii) with the percentage of annexin V-positive cells detected using flow cytometry. Depletion of p21  WAF/CIP1  was assessed by western blot ( XREF_FIG ) and did not induce significant apoptosis per se ( XREF_FIG ). Following a 16-h incubation with bortezomib, however, p21 WAF/CIP1  depletion resulted in significant (30%) caspase-3 cleavage ( XREF_FIG ), while promoting apoptosis in a high percentage (55%) of cells ( XREF_FIG ). Similar results were obtained using a different p21-specific siRNA (data not shown). Moreover, this effect was not specific to HeLa cells since p21 WAF/CIP1  depletion promoted bortezomib-induced apoptosis in Calu-I carcinoma cells (data not shown). Taken together, the present results thus strongly indicate that p21 upregulation can promote cancer cell resistance to bortezomib.\n\nTo further confirm the role of p21 in promoting resistance to bortezomib treatment, we performed clonogenic survival assays. HeLa cells were treated with p21-specific or control siRNAs, and following incubation with bortezomib, were washed to remove the drug, diluted and replated in fresh medium for 10 d, at which point colonies were counted. The results clearly showed that depleting p21 WAF/CIP1  significantly (40%) decreased cell survival and proliferation following treatment with bortezomib ( XREF_FIG ). Overall, the present data suggest that resistance of cancer cells to bortezomib-induced apoptosis involves p21 WAF/CIP1  upregulation.\n\n\n\nDepletion of CUGBP1 sensitizes HeLa cells to bortezomib-induced apoptosis.\n\nThe role of CUGBP1 in cancer cell resistance to apoptosis has not been previously investigated. From the above-described results ( XREF_FIG - XREF_FIG  XREF_FIG ), we hypothesized that CUGBP1 might promote resistance to bortezomib through p21 upregulation. In such a case, decreasing p21 expression via CUGBP1 depletion should promote apoptosis following bortezomib treatment. Thus, HeLa cells treated with CUGBP1-specific or control siRNAs were exposed to bortezomib (2 microM) for 16 h, and apoptosis was then assessed by caspase-3 cleavage ( XREF_FIG ) and annexin V assays ( XREF_FIG ). CUGBP1 depletion was confirmed by western blot ( XREF_FIG ) and did not induce significant apoptosis per se ( XREF_FIG ). Under bortezomib conditions, depletion of CUGBP1 induced cleavage of about 15% of total caspase-3 ( XREF_FIG ), and resulted in a significant percentage (30%) of cells undergoing apoptosis ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nThe present study clearly shows that bortezomib treatment of cancer cells upregulates p21 WAF1/CIP1  expression, which confers cellular resistance to apoptosis. Bortezomib-mediated p21 upregulation involves p21 mRNA accumulation in SG and its stabilization through the SG component CUGBP1. Our results suggest the following two-step model for bortezomib-induced p21 upregulation. In the first step, p21 mRNA is quantitatively sequestered into SG in a CUGBP1-dependent fashion, thereby protecting the normally highly unstable p21 mRNA against degradation, and contributing to its accumulation. The second step involves SG disassembly, thus releasing the large pool of accumulated p21 mRNA which is now available for immediate translation. This creates a massive pulse of p21 WAF1/CIP1  synthesis that helps preventing apoptosis despite proteasome inhibition by bortezomib. Our study therefore identified a potential survival pathway involving both CUGBP1 and p21 which could be therapeutically targeted to antagonize cancer cell resistance to bortezomib-mediated apoptosis.\n\nIncreasing evidence has implicated p21 as an anti-apoptotic factor that promotes cancer cell resistance to therapeutic agents. It has been shown that the treatment of cancer mesothelioma cells with chemotherapeutic drugs such as Irinotecan induces p21 expression and cellular senescence  XREF_BIBR . Depletion of p21 by specific short hairpin RNAs in tumor cells in vivo prevents Irinotecan-induced cell senescence, promotes apoptosis, and enhances the survival of Irinotecan-treated xenografts in animal models. p21 expression reduced the survival of Irinotecan-treated animals xenografted with mesothelioma tumor cells, in keeping with a potential role of p21 in chemoresistance  XREF_BIBR . Likewise, doxorubicin-treated breast, lung, and colon carcinoma cells undergo cellular senescence in vitro, which is characterized by a constitutively active ATM/ATR-dependent DNA damage response and the induction of p21  XREF_BIBR . Blocking the ATM kinase with specific inhibitors suppresses p21 expression and induces apoptosis, suggesting that p21 acts downstream of ATM to promote cancer chemoresistance. It will be interesting to assess the hypothesis that chemotherapeutic drugs such as Irinotecan and doxorubicin can induce p21 upregulation through mechanisms involving the CUGBP1-SG pathway described in this work. A recent study has shown that imatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor used for the therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), downregulates p21 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in sensitive CML cells, while resistant CML cells exhibit increased p21 expression  XREF_BIBR . Overexpression of p21 mediated by transient transfection confers resistance to imatinib, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that p21 upregulation might promote resistance to chemotherapy. Our study shows that suppressing the expression of endogenous p21 is sufficient to prevent resistance to bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Future studies will be conducted to investigate the possibility that imatinib might prevent the bortezomib-mediated upregulation of p21 expression, which would sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis induction by the proteasome inhibitor.\n\nThe mechanisms by which p21 antagonizes apoptosis are not yet clear. p21 can block apoptosis indirectly by arresting cell cycle after nuclear binding to cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes, or by increasing proliferation by promoting the nuclear accumulation of cyclin D-CDK4. However, FACS analysis of cell cycle progression shows that bortezomib does not affect cell cycle in our in vitro cancer cell model, despite the initial nuclear accumulation of p21 which is observed upon 10 h of bortezomib treatment. This result makes unlikely the possibility that p21-mediated resistance to bortezomib is due to its ability to arrest cell cycle. Moreover, protracted treatment (16 h) with bortezomib induces a cytoplasmic localization of p21. Stress-mediated cytoplasmic translocation of p21 involves its phosphorylation by kinases such as PKA and Akt  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Cytoplasmic p21 has been shown to interact with the apoptotic effector caspase-3, in a PKA-phosphorylation dependant manner  XREF_BIBR , and leading to resistance to Fas-mediated cell death  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Alternatively, Akt-phosphorylated p21 can inhibit cell death induced by TNFalpha and other stimuli by inactivating ASK1 in the cytoplasm  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . This MAPK kinase kinase activates the Jun N-terminal protein kinase in response to various genotoxic agents including proteasome inhibitors, which results with apoptosis  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Our immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an interaction between p21 and ASK1 during bortezomib treatment (Unpublished results). Although speculative at this stage, we propose that p21 inhibits bortezomib-mediated apoptosis by inactivating pro-apoptotic factors such as ASK1. Studies are underway to (i) determine the mechanisms underlying the cytoplasmic translocation of p21 and (ii) define if ASK1 is the target by which p21 prevents bortezomib-mediated apoptosis.\n\nOur study also provides evidence that CUGBP1 might act as a potential factor in resistance to bortezomib-mediated apoptosis by promoting p21 mRNA stabilization/accumulation and expression. Previous studies have shown that CUGBP1 promotes p21 mRNA expression in normal cells by loading the transcript into translating ribosomes  XREF_BIBR . On contrary, other reports identified CUGBP1 as a factor that inhibits the expression of its target mRNAs by promoting their decay in the cytoplasm  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Our study identified a novel role of CUGBP1 in promoting p21 mRNA stabilization during proteasome inhibition, which could involve its recruitment to SG. First, qRT-PCR showed that bortezomib highly induces p21 mRNA stabilization leading to its accumulation. Second, FISH experiments revealed that the p21 mRNA thus accumulating is quantitatively recruited to bortezomib-induced SG. The possible contribution of SG in protecting p21 mRNA from turnover is supported by findings that bortezomib-induced p21 mRNA accumulation is lost in HRI-depleted cells, which do not form SG. Third, actinomycin D experiments show that CUGBP1 depletion prevents bortezomib-induced p21 mRNA stabilization. CUGBP1 depletion does not affect, however, SG formation. This exclude the possibility that p21 mRNA destabilization observed in CUGBP1-depleted cells upon bortezomib treatment is due to a failure to form SG. Quantification of FISH data show that CUGBP1 depletion significantly decreased the overall amount of p21 mRNA, as compared to mock-depleted cells where most of the accumulated p21 mRNA was detected in SG. These latter results further corroborate our qRT-PCR data showing that CUGBP1 is required for p21 mRNA accumulation upon bortezomib treatment. However, CUGBP1 depletion does not affect the steady-state levels of p21 mRNA under SG-free conditions tested, further supporting previous reports  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  which indicate that CUGBP1 may not act as a general stabilizing factor in the cytoplasm. We suggest that CUGBP1 promotes p21 mRNA stabilization upon bortezomib treatment indirectly by inducing its recruitment into SG. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that CUGBP1 is not essential for recruiting p21 mRNA to SG, but is required instead for sequestering p21 mRNA in these structures. In any case however, our results show that under bortezomib conditions, CUGBP1 is required for p21 mRNA segregation in SG thus promoting its stabilization. At this stage, the mechanism responsible for the stabilization of p21 mRNA in SG remains to be determined. In general, destabilization of the mRNA involves both removal of its 5'-end cap structure (or decapping) and deadenylation of its polyA tail, followed by exoribonuclease digestion from both ends. Proteins that protect either the cap structure or the polyA tail, such as eIF4E and PABP, respectively, have been identified as SG components  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . In contrast, enzymes that activate decapping or deadenylation, such as Dcp1a and PARN, respectively, are absent from SG  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Thus, there is evidence that SG might protect p21 mRNA from degradation by isolating it from destabilizing factors, and CUGBP1 might promote p21 mRNA stabilization and accumulation either by recruitment or sequestration into SG. As a decaying factor, CUGBP1 was shown to interact directly with the PARN deadenylase to facilitate the removal of the poly(A) tail and thereby destabilize its target mRNAs  XREF_BIBR . It is thus tempting to speculate that the sequestration of CUGBP1 in SG prevented its association with PARN, thus protecting the associated p21 mRNA from turnover in SG. The association of CUGBP1 with p21 mRNA is likely to be subject to regulation by phosphorylation via the action of cyclin D3-cdk4/6  XREF_BIBR . Interestingly, the residue targeted for phosphorylation by cyclinD3-cdk4/6 (Ser302) lies within the linker region of CUGBP1  XREF_BIBR , which has been shown to be required for localization in SG upon arsenite treatment  XREF_BIBR . Future investigations should determine if CUGBP1 phosphorylation at Ser302 is required for its localization in SG, as a prerequisite to p21 mRNA accumulation. Upon disassembly of SG, a large fraction of the p21 mRNA pool becomes available for rapid translation, thereby creating a transient pulse of high p21 expression. Previous studies have shown that CUGBP1 promotes p21 translation in senescent cells through binding to the GC-rich element in the 5' region of p21 mRNA and loading of the mRNA onto ribosomes  XREF_BIBR . Following SG disassembly, therefore, CUGBP1 might also enhance p21 mRNA translation by promoting its association with ribosomes, although this remains to be demonstrated in a future study. In addition to GC-rich element, p21 mRNA contains two other regulatory elements, namely a AU-rich element and a GU-rich sequence located in its 3'-untranslated region. It is unlikely that the GU-rich element plays a role in the upregulation of p21 mRNA during proteasome inhibition, since this sequence is known to promote mRNA destabilization  XREF_BIBR . In contrast, the AU-rich element of p21 mRNA has been shown to confer p21 mRNA stabilization through its association with the RNA-binding protein HuR  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . However, our results show that HuR is dispensable for p21 mRNA accumulation during bortezomib treatment, suggesting that the AU-rich element is unlikely to be involved in the mechanism leading to p21 mRNA stabilization under bortezomib treatment. Studies are in progress to identify the cis-acting elements of p21 mRNA that interact with CUGBP1 in promoting localization and accumulation of this mRNA in SG. In addition to p21 mRNA, CUGBP1 might also promote localization of other mRNAs encoding antiapoptotic proteins in SG, thus leading to their accumulation. Several mRNAs encompassing GC-rich sequences in their 5'-region encode survival factors involved in the malignant phenotype, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and survivin  XREF_BIBR , which could be potential targets of CUGBP1. Future studies will determine the role of CUGBP1 in the regulation of anti-apoptotic factors such as VEGF and survivin during chemotherapy.\n\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nThe present study has identified p21 WAF1/CIP1  and its regulatory protein CUGBP1 as key players in the inhibition of apoptosis observed during treatment with bortezomib. Future studies should determine whether targeting these two factors might sensitize tumors to proteasome inhibitors in mouse models.\n\n",
