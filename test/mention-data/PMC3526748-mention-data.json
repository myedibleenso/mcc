In the previous study, We isolated glycoprotein (GDB) from Dioscorea batatas, characterized, and demonstrated immunostimulating activity in C57BL/6 mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism whereby GDB activates macrophages. Macrophages activation by GDB was investigated by analyzing the effects of GDB on nitric oxide (NO) production, iNOS expression, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, and transcription factor activation. In the presence of IFN-gamma, GDB strongly stimulated macrophages to express iNOS and produce NO. Furthermore, the activation of p38 was synergistically induced by GDB plus IFN-gamma , but SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) inhibited GDB plus IFN-gamma-induced p38 activation. This study indicates that GDB is an important activator of macrophages. Furthermore, due to the critical role that macrophage activation plays in innate immune response, the activation effects of GDB on macrophages suggest that GDB may be a useful immunopotentiating agent.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nDioscorea species are used in conventional medicine as a major source of steroid precursors, and are also used in traditional Chinese medicine [ XREF_BIBR ]. These plants have immunomodulatory activity in vitro on the viability, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and on IFN-gamma secretion by splenic lymphocytes [ XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, phytochemical investigations have shown that steroid saponins are the active principles of Dioscorea species [ XREF_BIBR ]. Members of this species have long been used in traditional medicine to treat poor appetite, chronic diarrhea, asthma, dry coughs, frequent or uncontrollable urination, diabetes, and emotional instability [ XREF_BIBR ]. Plants of the genus Dioscorea of the Dioscoreaceae family are commonly referred to as yams. Immunostimulating activities of yam storage protein from Dioscorea alata, japonica and batatas have been described previously [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Yam is an important crop, which is basically made up of carbohydrates but also constitutes an important source of proteins accounting for 1~3% of the fresh tubers [ XREF_BIBR ]. We isolated glycoprotein from Dioscorea batatas, characterized, and demonstrated immunostimulating activity in C57BL/6 mice [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nMacrophages can be activated by cytokines, such as, IFN-gamma, or by microbial components, such as, LPS [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ], and play pivotal roles in both nonspecific and specific immunity. For nonspecific immunity, macrophages trap and kill microbes, and release inflammatory mediators, such as, nitric oxide (NO). For nonspecific immunity, macrophages act as antigen presenting cells and release cytokines, such as, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12 to regulate helper T cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, activated macrophages suppress the growths of a variety of tumor cells and microorganisms [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, strong activation of macrophages causes the releases excessive cytokines and mediators, including NO, which has been implicated in many pathophysiological conditions including inflammation, atherosclerosis, and septic shock [ XREF_BIBR ]. Due to the critical role that macrophage activation plays in innate immune response, immunomodulating compounds target macrophages [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ].\n\nMacrophage activation by certain external stimuli including lipopolysaccharide, a component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, results in the phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which includes ERK1/2, stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK)/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK [ XREF_BIBR ]. p38, ERK1/2, and SAPK/JNK are serine threonine kinases that are located in the cytoplasm until activated by dual phosphorylation of their Tyr and Thr residues at Thr-Gly-Tyr, Thr-Glu-Tyr, or Thr-Pro-Tyr, respectively [ XREF_BIBR ]. The activation of MAPK stimulates transcription factors, such as, NF-kappaB and AP-1 [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the synergistic effect of glycoprotein (GDB) isolated from Dioscorea batatas and IFN-gamma on iNOS gene expression by macrophages. We further analyzed the effects of GDB on the activation of MAPK in RAW264.7cells.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\nSynergistic induction of iNOS by GDB and IFN-gamma.\n\nThe glycoproteins (GDB) isolated from Dioscorea batatas were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and produced a single band at 30 kD ( XREF_FIG ). To investigate macrophage activation by GDB, we treated RAW264.7 macrophage cells with GDB (50 microg/ml) in the presence of IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml) and analyzed iNOS expression by immunofluorescence staining ( XREF_FIG ). GDB plus IFN-gamma strongly stimulated macrophages to produce iNOS and induced morphological changes. To analyze the effect of GDB plus IFN-gamma on iNOS gene expression further, we performed Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. GDB plus IFN-gamma significantly induced iNOS gene expression, whereas GDB plus IFN-gamma alone did not ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nSynergistic induction of NO generation by GDB and IFN-gamma.\n\nTo investigate macrophage activation by GDB, we analyzed the effects of GDB on nitrite levels, which is produced from NO in RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were treated with IFN-gamma (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of GDB (25 microg/ml) for 24 h. Supernatants were then isolated and analyzed for nitrite generation. GDB (25 microg/ml) plus IFN-gamma (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/ml) significantly induced nitrite generation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas IFN-gamma alone did not ( XREF_FIG ). LPS (200 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. The synergistic induction of nitrite by GDB (1, 10, 25, and 50 microg/ml) plus IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml) was further confirmed in RAW264.7 cells ( XREF_FIG ). GDB (1, 10, 25, and 50 microg/ml) alone did not increase the nitrite generation.\n\n\n\nSynergistic activation of p38 by GDB plus IFN-gamma in RAW264.7 cells.\n\nMost cellular responses to extracellular stimuli are mediated by kinase and phosphatase cascades. The MAPKs are one of the most important kinase families in inflammatory cells, and its members have been strongly conserved through evolution, suggesting that they play vital roles in intracellular signaling. Thus, since MAPKs play important roles in macrophage activation, we analyzed the effects of GDB on MAPK activity by immunoblotting. When cells were treated with GDB (1, 10, and 25 microg/ml) for 30 min, we found that phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and especially of SAPK/JNK, was markedly induced ( XREF_FIG ). ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylations were induced by IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml), and the phosphorylation was not further activated by GDB. The phosphorylation of p38 kinase was not strongly induced by GDB or IFN-gamma. However, interestingly cotreatment of RAW264.7 cells with GDB and IFN-gamma strongly induced p38 phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ). This synergistic induction of p38 by GDB and IFN-gamma corresponds well with the activation of iNOS gene expression. These results suggest that GDB activates macrophages by activating signal transduction pathways, such as, p38, ERK1/2, and SAPK/JNK.\n\nWe further investigated whether the p38 kinase pathway is involved in GDB and IFN-gamma-induced nitrite generation. We specifically blocked the p38 kinase pathway and then monitored nitrite production when RAW 264.7 cells were challenged with GDB plus IFN-gamma. SB203580, a bicyclic imidazole inhibitor of p38, inhibited GDB plus IFN-gamma-induced nitrite production ( XREF_FIG ). However, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-1, did not. LPS-induced nitrite production was also inhibited by SB203580 but not by PD98059 ( XREF_FIG ). However, GDB plus IFN-gamma-induced nitrite production was not inhibited by polymyxin B (an LPS inhibitor), whereas LPS-induced nitrite generation was strongly inhibited by polymyxin B ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that p38 kinase pathway is importantly involved in the regulation of iNOS expression induced by GDB plus IFN-gamma.\n\n\n\nEffects of GDB on the activation of NF-kappaB in RAW264.7 cells.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism whereby GDB plus IFN-gamma activate macrophages, we analyzed the effect of GDB on NF-kappaB, AP-1, and Oct 1, whose binding sites are located in the promoter of iNOS gene. EMSA showed that treating RAW264.7 cells with GDB plus IFN-gamma for 2 h did induce NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, whereas GDB alone dose-dependently induced NF-kappaB DNA binding activity ( XREF_FIG ). Both AP-1 and Oct1 were found to have small basal DNA binding activities and to be moderately induced by GDB ( XREF_FIG ). The specificity of bindings was demonstrated by competition assays using  32 P-unlabeled kappaB or mutant kappaB probes (data not shown). These results suggest that GDB activates NF-kappaB, which is known to play an important role in the activation and production of cytokines in macrophages.\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nThe present study demonstrates that GDB and IFN-gamma synergistically induce NO production. In the presence of IFN-gamma, GDB strongly increased NO production, whereas GDB alone did not activate macrophages to produce NO ( XREF_FIG ). The synergistic induction of iNOS gene expression by GDB plus IFN-gamma was further confirmed by Western blotting and RT-PCR ( XREF_FIG ). Although activated macrophages suppress the growths of a variety of tumor cells and microorganisms [ XREF_BIBR ], excessive production of NO is implicated in many pathophysiological conditions. For example LPS, a strong inducer of NO, cause cell and tissue damage, which can lead to multiple organ failure - the clinical hallmark of sepsis [ XREF_BIBR ]. Synergism with IFN-gamma (an endogenous mediator of immune response) highlights the importance of the immune modulatory role of GDB.\n\nWe also found that GDB activated MAPKs. Interestingly, GDB plus IFN-gamma synergistically activated p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, this synergistic activation of p38 by GDB plus IFN-gamma corresponded well with the synergistic induction of NO generation and iNOS expression. In the presence of IFN-gamma, GDB strongly increased p38 phosphorylation, whereas GDB alone did not activate macrophages to phosphorylate p38 ( XREF_FIG ). We also confirmed the involvement of the p38 pathway in GDB plus IFN-gamma mediated NO production, because NO generation was dramatically diminished in the presence of SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK). In contrast PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of MEK1) had no effect on NO generation by GDB plus IFN-gamma. The p38 kinase pathway is also important for LPS-induced NO production, as shown in  XREF_FIG . In a previous study [ XREF_BIBR ], we confirmed that the p38 pathway is specifically involved in LPS-induced iNOS expression.\n\nAlthough GDB plus IFN-gamma was not found to synergistically activate SAPK/JNK, GDB alone strongly and dose-dependently induced SAPK/JNK phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that GDB mediates immune modulation via the differential activations of MAPKs by itself or in combination with other cytokines. MAPKs transmit extracellular signals to the nucleus, where the transcriptions of specific genes are induced by the phosphorylations and activations of transcription factors. Furthermore, different environmental stimuli trigger the activations of different MAPKs via different pathways. For example, the ERK MAPKs are activated by a Ras-dependent pathway in response to many growth factors and hormones [ XREF_BIBR ], whereas the SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPKs are activated by environmental stresses, such as, UV radiation, osmotic shock, heat shock, protein synthesis inhibitors, LPS, and by proinflammatory cytokines, such as, IL-1 and TNF [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\nMacrophages play a pivotal role in immune response by presenting antigens to lymphocytes during the development of specific immunity and by releasing soluble factors [ XREF_BIBR ]. Macrophages also produce protective factors that are involved in host defense and inflammation. Once activated, macrophages produce a number of cytotoxic molecules, such as, NO [ XREF_BIBR ], which is also cytotoxic to certain tumor cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. In a previous study, we found that GDB can exert significant immunomodulatory effects on specific immune responses mediated by macrophages, lymphocytes, and NK cells in vitro and in vivo [ XREF_BIBR ]. GDB treatment of C57BL/6 mice caused a significant increase in the numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages in the peritoneal cavity, and both of these cell types play important roles in the first line of immunological defense against tumor cells. Therefore, we assessed the effects of GDB on NK cells and macrophage function. We found that NK cell activity and the cytotoxic effects of macrophages on tumor cells significantly increased in GDB-treated groups.\n\nAlthough we could not identify the membrane receptor for GDB in the present study, some membrane proteins, such as, CR3, CD14, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are known to act as receptors in macrophages. Complement receptor CR3 (also called CD11b/CD18, Mac-1, and alpha M beta 2 -integrin) is a membrane receptor for beta-glucans [ XREF_BIBR ], and CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expressed on the surfaces of monocytes and neutrophils that binds LPS with high affinity [ XREF_BIBR ]. These receptors expressed on the surfaces of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells and are important in numerous cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions [ XREF_BIBR ]. The TLRs are a mammalian transmembrane protein family and are known to play important roles in innate immune recognition [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nThe immunostimulating activities of yam storage protein from Dioscorea alata and japonica have been previously described [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Yam is basically composed of carbohydrates but also contains many proteins, which account for 1~3% of the weight of fresh tubers [ XREF_BIBR ]. Two proteins identified in D. alata tubers, dioscorins and phytoglycoproteins [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] are known to activate MAP kinases (ERK, p38, and JNK) and NF-kappaB via the TLR-4 signal transduction pathway and increases the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6, in several cells including RAW 264.7 macrophages, murine monocytes, and human monocytes [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. We previously isolated glycoprotein from Dioscorea batatas, and characterized and demonstrated its immunostimulatory activity [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn summary, the present study shows that GDB is a potent modulator of immune response. Based on our findings, macrophage activation best explains this biological effect. Due to the critical role that macrophage activation plays in innate immune response, the activation of macrophages by GDB suggests that this compound should be regarded as a potentially useful immunopotentiating agent.\n\n",
