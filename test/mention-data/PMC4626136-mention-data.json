The present study investigated the effect of PMA infection on microglial senescence. From 58 male Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 were randomly selected and divided into a PMA injection group, containing five rats (0.5 microg/microl PMA) and a control group, containing five rats (commensurable 0.9% saline). Immunofluorescent staining of Iba-1 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses of the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta were performed in these two groups. The remaining 48 rats were randomly divided into the following three groups, each containing 16 rats: Repeated injection control group (commensurable normal saline, once a week for 4 weeks), single PMA injection group (0.5 microg/microl PMA, once in the first week) and repeated injection PMA group (0.5 microg/microl PMA, once a week for 4 weeks). The expression levels of p21, detected using double immunofluorescence staining with Iba-1, and beta-galactosidase, via double immunohistochemical staining of Iba-1, were examined in these three groups. The results indicated that a single injection of PMA did not change the microglial morphology and had no significant effects on the expression levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, compared with the control group (P>0.05). Following four repeated injections of PMA, the microglia in the substantia nigra presented with features of senescence, characterized by increased expression levels of beta-galactosidase (P<0.001) and p21 (P<0.001), compared with the repeated injection control group. In conclusion, repeated intra-nigrostriatal treatment with PMA induced microglial senescence with increased expression levels of beta-galactosidase and p21 in the substantia nigra of the rats.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nMicroglia are one of the resident populations of mononuclear phagocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and account for 10% of the total glial cell population in the brain ( XREF_BIBR ). Increasing evidence has suggested that microglia have neurotoxic effects when they are overactivated following severe injury or during neurodegenerative disease ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). The neurotoxic effects of the activated microglia in the aged neurodegenerative brain may result in age-associated microglia senescence ( XREF_BIBR ). Microglia senescence, which underlies the alterations of microglial function and incorrect responses to stimuli, can promote eventual neurodegeneration ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). Emerging evidence has indicated that microglial senescence can contribute to age-associated neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). The most prominent features of microglial senescence are morphological alterations, described as dystrophy, and alterations in the inflammatory profile ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). In addition, a previous study indicated that the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta are increased in the brains of senescence-accelerated mice ( XREF_BIBR ).\n\nSenescence is a state of irreversible cell withdrawal from the proliferative pool, and occurs at the exhaustion of the proliferative lifespan ( XREF_BIBR ). Cellular senescence is characterized by elevated endogenous beta-galactosidase activity, which is commonly used as a marker for cellular senescence ( XREF_BIBR ). In addition, the induction of p21, the first identified inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, is essential for the onset of cell cycle arrest in cell senescence ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). Senescence can also be caused by pathological stimulation, including the activation of oncogenes (oncogene-induced senescence; OIS) ( XREF_BIBR ). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), commonly known as 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, is a potent tumor promoter, which is often applied in biomedical investigations to activate the signal transduction enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC) ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ), which is involved in oncogene activation. In addition, it has also been reported that senescence can be driven by the activation of PKC ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). Therefore, the present study hypothesized that PMA, as a carcinogen, can also induce microglial senescence. In the present study, the expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, beta-galactosidase and p21 in the substantia nigra of rats were investigated, as were the effects on these levels of expression following PMA administration\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nResting state of microglia 1 week following single PMA injection.\n\nAs shown in  XREF_FIG , the majority of the microglia were in the resting state with typical ramified branches in the PMA-injected group ( XREF_FIG ). Analysis of ELISA demonstrated no significant difference in the expression levels of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta between the control group and PMA injected group (P>0.05;  XREF_FIG ). These results indicated that PMA had no significant effect on the microglia following a single injection at one week.\n\n\n\nExpression of beta-galactosidase is increased in microglia following repeated injections of PMA.\n\nImages of the double immunofluorescence staining are shown in  XREF_FIG . There were more double-stained positive cells in the repeated PMA injection group, compared with the repeated injection control group (P<0.001) and single PMA injection group (P=0.002), as shown in  XREF_FIG . However, the numbers of double-stained positive cells in the single PMA injection group were not significantly increased, compared with those in the repeated injection control group (P=0.777). The percentage of double-stained positive cells in the repeated PMA injection group (17.15+/-4.25%) was significantly increased, compared with the repeated injection control group (10.34+/-1.86%; P<0.001) and single PMA injection group (11.32+/-1.76%; P=0.002), respectively. These results suggested that repeated injection of PMA increased the expression of beta-galactosidase in the microglia in the substantia nigra of the rats.\n\n\n\nExpression of p21 increases in microglia following repeated injections of PMA.\n\nRepresentative double-staining images of p21 and Iba-1 are shown in  XREF_FIG . The numbers of microglia exhibiting positive expression of p21 were significantly higher in the repeated PMA injection group, compared with the repeated injection control group (P<0.001) and the single PMA injection group (P<0.001), as shown in  XREF_FIG . The numbers of double-stained positive cells in the single PMA injection group were not significantly increased, compared to the repeated injection control group (P=0.912). The percentage of double-stained positive cells in the repeated PMA injection group (16.67+/-2.17%) was significantly increased, compared with the repeated injection control group (11.31+/-1.76%; P<0.001) and single PMA injection group (11.64+/-1.87%; P<0.001), respectively. These results indicated that repeated injection of PMA increased the expression of p21 in the microglia in the substantia nigra of the rats.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn the present study, the effect of intra-nigrostriatal injection of PMA on microglia senescence was investigated. The results demonstrated that PMA had no significant effect on the microglia following a single injection at one week. Following four repeated injections of PMA, microglia in the substantia nigra exhibited certain senescence characteristics, including increased expression levels of beta-galactosidase and p21. These results demonstrated that repeated injection of PMA resulted in microglia senescence, whereas a single injection of PMA did not induce microglia senescence in the substantia nigra of the rats.\n\nMicroglia senescence is manifested by morphological changes and alterations in inflammatory profile ( XREF_BIBR ). The observation of morphological alterations, characterized by cytoplasmic fragmentation, twisting processes and clusters, has been used in several studies to identify dystrophic microglia ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). In the present study, the majority of the microglia presented with no dystrophic microglia features in the PMA injection group, indicating that a single PMA injection did not lead to morphological changes, which is one of the characteristics of microglia senescence. Microglia belong to the macrophage lineage and are the predominant form of active immune defense in the CNS. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are two predominant proinflammatory cytokines produced by microglia during CNS inflammation ( XREF_BIBR ). In rodents, reports have suggested that production of the TNF-alpha and IL-1beta proinflammatory cytokines are increased in the brain of the senescence accelerated mouse ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ), while others have suggested that the proinflammatory cytokines are decreased in macrophages with aging ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). The results of the present study demonstrated that the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were not significantly altered 1 week following a single PMA injection. These results suggested that microglia senescence did not occur in the substantia nigra 1 week-post single PMA injection.\n\nPrevious studies have reported that the expression level of beta-galactosidase is increased during senescence ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). In addition, the expression of p21 is increased during cell senescence ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). A previous study found that, in response to repeated lipopolysaccharide administration to mimic chronic inflammation, cultured BV2 microglial cells exhibited signs of senescence, including growth arrest and enhanced beta-galactosidase activity ( XREF_BIBR ). In the present study, repeated administration of PMA increased the expression levels of beta-galactosidase and p21 in the substantia nigra of the rats, which indicated that repeated administration of PMA induced microglia senescence in the substantia nigra of the rats. PMA, a potent tumor promoter, can activate PKC in vivo and in vitro by binding to PKC, resulting in several types of cellular effects ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). Studies have indicated that PMA can activate oncogenes, including Ras, in vivo and in vitro ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). In addition, Serrano et al first reported that the expression of oncogenic Ras results in a permanent G1 arrest in primary human or rodent cells in OIS ( XREF_BIBR ). Studies have also indicated that the accumulation of p21 can mediate G1 arrest ( XREF_BIBR ). Several studies also have demonstrated that the activation of oncogenes can induce OIS, and melanocytic nevi provide a clear example of OIS ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). Thus, PMA induced microglia senescence may be associated with oncogenic Ras-induced G1 arrest, which also mediated by p21 in OIS.\n\nPMA can also lead to oxidative stress in vitro ( XREF_BIBR ). Studies have demonstrated that various forms of oxidative stress can induce senescence, including exposure to reactive oxygen species ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). Cultured astrocytes can undergo cellular senescence with the development of characteristics of senescence, including growth arrest, expression of beta-galactosidase and increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 in response to a variety of stressors, including oxidative stress ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). Thus, oxidative stress-induced senescence may be another potential mechanism of PMA-induced microglia senescence.\n\nPMA, as a carcinogen, can induce activation of endogenic oncogenes, and resulted in microglia senescence in the substantia nigra in the present study. Oncogenes can be activated by various stimulants, which can cause tumorigenesis ( XREF_BIBR ). Microglia senescence is a major factor contributing to the development of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases ( XREF_BIBR ). There is a close connection between tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration ( XREF_BIBR ), PD, as a neurodegenerative disease, has been reported to be associated with a decreased risk of developing cancer ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ). Therefore, the result of the present study that PMA induced microglia senescence, provided further evidence supporting the interaction between tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated that repeated intra-nigrostriatal treatment with PMA for carcinogen stimulation induced microglia senescence, which may be associated with OIS- and oxidative stress-induced senescence. In addition, these results provide novel evidence for the link between tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration.\n\n",
