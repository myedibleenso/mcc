      "text":"Essential oil of Pinus koraiensis inhibits cell proliferation and migration via inhibition of p21-activated kinase 1 pathway in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground.\n\nThe essential oil of Pinus koraiensis (EOPK) is biologically active compound obtained from the leaves of P. koraiensis. The goal of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer mechanism of EOPK in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.\n\n\n\nMethods.\n\nHCT116 cell proliferation was assessed by conducting crystal violet and BrdU assays. To assess the effects of EOPK on cell migration, we performed a wound-healing assay. Further, the contribution of PAK1 to EOPK-induced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) suppression was assessed by siRNA-mediated PAK1 knockdown. Changes to the expression and phosphorylation of PAK1 and its effectors were determined by western blotting, and changes to the actin cytoskeleton were determined by performing an immunofluorescence assay.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\nEOPK significantly decreased HCT116 cell proliferation and migration, and induced G1 arrest without affecting normal cells. Additionally, EOPK suppressed the expression of PAK1, and decreased ERK and AKT phosphorylation in HCT116 cells. Finally, EOPK suppressed beta-catenin, cyclin D1, and CDK4/6 expression.\n\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nOur studies indicate that EOPK significantly reduced proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, EOPK suppressed PAK1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, and this suppression of PAK1 led to inhibition of ERK, AKT, and beta-catenin activities. Our findings suggest that EOPK exerts its anticancer activity via the inhibition of PAK1 expression, suggesting it may be a potent chemotherapeutic agent for colorectal cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground.\n\nColorectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in the Western world [ XREF_BIBR ]. The pathogenesis of colorectal cancer involves several processes, including enhanced cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation [ XREF_BIBR ]. Importantly, K-Ras and B-Raf mutations have been identified in 40% and 10% of colorectal cancers, respectively [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Mutations in K-Ras and B-Raf activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways. In colorectal cancer, overexpression of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK promotes cell survival, proliferation, and migration [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ].\n\nThe p21 activated kinase (PAK) family of proteins has been identified as a novel target for cancer therapies [ XREF_BIBR ]. PAKs are downstream effectors of the Rho family GTPases, which regulate cell motility and survival. There are six isoforms of PAK that are classified into two families, Group I (PAK1-3) and Group II (PAK4-6). Group I PAKs differ from Group II PAKs in both structure and mechanisms of activation [ XREF_BIBR ]. PAK1 is an important effector of Rac and Cdc42 that regulates cell transformation and tumor proliferation [ XREF_BIBR ]. Activated PAK1 enhances cell survival and migration via the AKT pathway, and stimulates transformation through the Ras/Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway. PAK1 knockdown was shown to inhibit the activation of beta-catenin in colorectal cancer, thereby inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and proliferation [ XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, PAK1 overexpression occurs in a variety of human cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. Thus, PAK1 may play an important role in cell growth, adhesion, migration, and survival in colorectal cancer, through the activation of AKT, ERK and beta-catenin [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ].\n\nPinus koraiensis, generally called the Korean nut pine, is an evergreen tree found in Korea, China, Japan, and eastern Russia. Unlike the common Pinaceae plants, P. koraiensis shows leaves (needles) in fascicles (bundles) of five. Essential oil derived from P. koraiensis (EOPK) contains a number of components, including D-limonene, beta-pinene, 4-carene, camphene, beta-phellandrene, and fencyl [ XREF_BIBR ]. Much is known about the role of EOPK in obesity. For example, our group previously reported that EOPK has an >anti-hyperlipidemic effect through the up-regulation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and the inhibition of acyl-coenzyme A [ XREF_BIBR ]. Further, a recent report on the effects of EOPK indicated that the oil has anti-obesity and hypolipidemic activity in vitro and in vivo, using 3T3-L1 cells and high fat diet-fed rats [ XREF_BIBR ]. Additional studies have shown that EOPK is a potential anti-diabetic agents and that the nut of P. koraiensis has antioxidant activity in vivo\n[ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Others studies have demonstrated that the Korean pine nut is an appetite suppressant, and reduced weight gain in mice fed a high fat diet [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether EOPK may have an anti-cancer effect. In the present study, we examined the antitumor mechanism of EOPK in vitro in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nPAK1 mediates the MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in colorectal cancer cells.\n\nPAK1 expression increases with the progression of colorectal cancer [ XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, we first assessed PAK1 expression levels in mouse and human colorectal cancer cell lines by Western blot. PAK1 was expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines including Colon26L5, HCT116, HCT15, HT29, and SW620 cells. PAK1 expression was significantly lower in normal murine colon cells than in cancer cells                    .\n\nPAK1 is a central node for various oncogenic signaling pathways, including the Ras/Raf/MAPK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. To assess the contribution of PAK1 to oncogenic signaling pathways in colon cancer cells, we knocked down PAK1 expression with siRNA. siRNA-mediated PAK1 knockdown attenuated both beta-catenin expression and the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK                    .\n\n\n\nEOPK inhibits the expression of PAK1.\n\nTo investigate the effect of EOPK on PAK1, the cells were treated with EOPK (100mug/ml) and Western blotting was performed. EOPK significantly suppressed the protein expression of PAK1 in colon cancer cell lines, as shown in Figure XREF_FIG C. Further, we assessed the cytotoxicity of EOPK in NIH-3T3 cells as a normal cell control. EOPK had no significant cytotoxic effect in NIH-3T3 cells                    .\n\n\n\nEOPK induces G1-arrest and inhibits cell proliferation and migration.\n\nWe next performed cell cycle analysis following EOPK treatment in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Cells were treated with 100mug/ml of EOPK for 24h, and were then analyzed by FACS. Treatment with EOPK significantly increased G1-arrest in HCT116 cells                    .\n\nTo investigate whether EOPK suppressed the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells, a cell growth assay was performed. This assay assessed the effect of EOPK on the long-term (5 d) growth of colorectal cancer cells. As shown in Figure XREF_FIG B, EOPK significantly suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, 100mug/mL EOPK suppressed HCT116 growth 99.9%. Consistently, a BrdU assay showed that EOPK treatment inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner                    .\n\nTo better understand the inhibitory effect of EOPK on cell migration, we used a wound-healing assay. As shown in Figure XREF_FIG D, EOPK significantly decreased serum-induced cell migration by 29.4%, 48.6% and 85.8% as compared to the untreated control at 25, 50, and 100mug/ml EOPK, respectively.\n\n\n\nEOPK attenuates beta-catenin expression and AKT, and ERK phosphorylation via PAK1.\n\nTo assess whether the PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways contributed to the inhibitory effect of EOPK, the protein expression levels of PAK1, beta-catenin, phosphor-AKT, and phosphor-ERK were investigated by Western blotting. EOPK remarkably suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and PAK1, as well as the expression of beta-catenin in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells                    . We previously showed that siRNA knockdown of PAK1 reduced phosphorylation AKT and ERK                    . This is consistent with previous reports, in which, knockdown of PAK1 in colorectal cancer cells by shRNA suppressed cell proliferation via the ERK and AKT pathways [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Interestingly, PAK1 knockdown enhanced the inhibitory effect of EOPK on beta-catenin expression and phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in HCT116 cells                    .\n\n\n\nPAK1 mediates EOPK-induced G1 arrest, suppression of cell proliferation and migration, and altered actin cytoskeletal arrangement.\n\nWe next assessed whether EOPK-mediated G1 arrest is dependent on PAK1 inhibition. Knockdown of PAK1 by siRNA reduced the expression of G1 regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6                    . Consequently, PAK1 knockdown enhanced EOPK-mediated inhibition of proliferation, as assessed by cell growth assay                    . Further, PAK1 knockdown also enhanced EOPK-mediated cell migration, as determined using a wound healing assay                    . PAK1 plays a critical role in migration, invasion, and proliferation through its regulation of actin cytoskeletal reorganization [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. To determine whether the EOPK-mediated suppression of migration was due to inhibition of PAK1-mediated actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, an immunofluorescence assay was performed. In tis assay, rhodamine phalloidin was used to detect F-actin. Knockdown of PAK1 by siRNA reduced basal spread of cells and increased cell rounding. In addition, knockdown of PAK1 enhanced EOPK-mediated alterations of actin cytoskeleton in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells                    .\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nOur findings show that EOPK efficaciously inhibits the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells in vitro. Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a standard therapeutic agent used in the treatment of colorectal cancer since the 1950s. However, not all of patients respond to 5-FU [ XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, recent work identifying the antitumor effects of natural products indicates they may be a promising alternative therapeutic for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Many extracts from vegetables, fruits, and plants, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and Morus alba leaf extract, can inhibit cell proliferation and survival, and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Here, we show that EOPK significantly decreases proliferation and migration in colorectal cancer cells, without affecting normal cells. Recent reports have indicated that EOPK has anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, essential oil from P. koraiensis seeds, leaves, nuts, and cones have been shown to have biological efficacy [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. However, the effect of EOPK on tumor proliferation and survival has not been examined to date.\n\nPAK1 was recently shown to be an effective therapeutic target for cancer treatment [ XREF_BIBR ]. Interestingly, we found that EOPK treatment significantly reduced PAK1 expression in several colon cancer cells. It is well known that PAK1 mediates cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival through the ERK and AKT signaling pathways [ XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, to confirm the involvement of PAK1 in EOPK-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, we analyzed the effects of EOPK on AKT and ERK phosphorylation in HCT116 cells. Knockdown of PAK1 with siRNA enhanced the inhibitory effect of EOPK on AKT and ERK phosphorylation in HCT116 cells. Further, PAK1 knockdown enhanced EOPK-mediated inhibition of PAK1 activity. Combined, these data suggest that EOPK suppresses cell growth and migration via the inhibition of PAK1, AKT, and ERK signaling in colon cancer cells. In addition, PAK1 is known to be involved in macrophage spreading and migration, and previous work indicates that PAK1 acts via ERK1/2 to regulate lamellipodia formation [ XREF_BIBR ]. We showed that EOPK significantly suppressed actin cytoskeletal rearrangement in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, EOPK significantly decreased proliferation and migration, induced G1-arrest, and inhibited the expression of phospho-ERK, phospho-AKT, beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 in colorectal cancer cells.\n\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that EOPK reduces proliferation of HCT116 cells through G1 arrest, without affecting normal cells. EOPK inhibits cell migration and alters cytoskeletal structure, through the reduction of basal spread and cell elongation and increased cell rounding. EOPK-induced G1 arrest, inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and suppressed actin cytoskeletal rearrangement via the inhibition of PAK1. This inhibition of PAK1 resulted in decreases in ERK and AKT phosphorylation and beta-catenin expression. Combined, our findings provide evidence that EOPK may be a novel therapeutic for the treatment of colorectal cancer. There is great potential for the development of novel chemotherapeutics from the leaves of P. koraiensis.\n\n",
