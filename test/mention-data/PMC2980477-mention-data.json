      "text":"RhoH Regulates Subcellular Localization of ZAP-70 and Lck in T Cell Receptor Signaling.\n\n\n\nRhoH is an hematopoietic-specific, GTPase-deficient Rho GTPase that plays a role in T development. We investigated the mechanisms of RhoH function in TCR signaling. We found that the association between Lck and CD3zeta was impaired in RhoH-deficient T cells, due to defective translocation of both Lck and ZAP-70 to the immunological synapse. RhoH with Lck and ZAP-70 localizes in the detergent-soluble membrane fraction where the complex is associated with CD3zeta phosphorylation. To determine if impaired translocation of ZAP-70 was a major determinant of defective T cell development, Rhoh -/-  bone marrow cells were transduced with a chimeric myristoylation-tagged ZAP-70. Myr-ZAP-70 transduced cells partially reversed the in vivo defects of RhoH-associated thymic development and TCR signaling. Together, our results suggest that RhoH regulates TCR signaling via recruitment of ZAP-70 and Lck to CD3zeta in the immunological synapse. Thus, we define a new function for a RhoH GTPase as an adaptor molecule in TCR signaling pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nRhoH, an hematopoietic-specific Rho GTPase,was first identified as a fusion transcript with Bcl-6 in B-cell diffuse large cell lymphoma XREF_BIBR . RhoH is a member of RhoE/Rnd3 subfamily that has no intrinsic GTPase activity and remains in a GTP-bound and constitutively active state. RhoH cellular function has been reported to be controlled at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . For example, RhoH mRNA is down-regulated after phorbol myristate acetate treatment in Jurkat T cells and after stimulation of T cell receptor (TCR) in Th1 cells XREF_BIBR .\n\nRhoH has also been proposed to function as a negative regulator of other Rho GTPases, particularly Rac. For instance, RhoH is a potent inhibitor of the activation of NF kappa B and p38 kinase by other Rho GTPases in Jurkat T cells XREF_BIBR . Overexpression of RhoH impairs the activation of Rac GTPases and negatively regulates the Rac-mediated cortical F-actin assembly and chemotaxis in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . The level of activated Rac GTPases is elevated in Rhoh -/-  HPCs XREF_BIBR .\n\nWe previously demonstrated that Rhoh -/-  mice have impaired TCR signaling, resulting in defective thymocyte selection and blocked maturation of T cells XREF_BIBR . CD3zeta phosphorylation and translocation of ZAP-70 to the immunological synapse are impaired in RhoH-deficient T cells, which results in the defective activation of components of ZAP-70-mediated signaling pathway including Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT) and p44/42 MAP kinase XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Upon TCR stimulation, RhoH is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like motif which leads to enhanced interaction of RhoH and ZAP-70 XREF_BIBR . Thus, RhoH plays a critical role in TCR signaling and activation of ZAP-70 and is essential for T cell development and TCR-mediated function.\n\nTCR signaling is controlled by complex cross-regulation of several key downstream signaling components. ZAP-70 has been reported to promote the phosphorylation of CD3zeta and the association of CD3zeta with Lck, as ZAP-70 deficiency impairs the TCR-induced CD3zeta phosphorylation XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Although RhoH-deficient T cells also have defective recruitment of ZAP-70 to TCR and CD3zeta phosphorylation is impaired in Rhoh -/-  T cells XREF_BIBR , the molecular underpinnings of how RhoH regulates Lck-mediated CD3zeta phosphorylation via ZAP-70 in TCR signaling remain unclear. Here, we investigated further the role of RhoH in localizing ZAP-70 to the TCR and the potential role of RhoH in Lck-mediated CD3zeta activation. In Rhoh -/-  T cells, Lck showed impaired association with CD3zeta and decreased localization to the immunologic synapse. This was not associated with defects in its kinase activity as measured by in vitro kinase assay. Further biochemical data suggest that RhoH regulates CD3zeta phosphorylation by recruiting ZAP-70 and Lck to the cell membrance fraction to form the TCR complex for TCR signaling activation. In these studies, we found that membrane-targeted ZAP-70 could partially rescue the defective TCR signaling in RhoH-deficient T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that RhoH regulates TCR signaling via recruiting ZAP-70 and Lck to CD3zeta in the immunological synapse for activation of downstream signaling molecules.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nDefective interaction between Lck and CD3zeta in RhoH-deficient T cells.\n\nEngagement of the TCR results in the activation of the Src family phosphotyrosine kinase (PTK), Lck XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Activated Lck phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the ITAMs in the CD3zeta subunits of the TCR. ZAP-70 is then recruited to the phosphorylated CD3zeta and is activated by Lck XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . We previously reported that Rhoh -/-  T cells demonstrate defective CD3zeta phosphorylation and ZAP-70 recruitment to the TCR complex which results in the impaired TCR signaling and T cell development XREF_BIBR . We investigated whether impaired Lck activation could be responsible for this TCR signaling defect in RhoH-deficient thymocytes as well as peripheral T cells. While Lck in vitro kinase activity was similar in wild type (WT) and Rhoh -/-  thymocytes ( XREF_FIG ), the association between Lck and CD3zeta and the phosphorylation of CD3zeta were impaired in Rhoh -/-  T cells ( XREF_FIG ). Lck activity is regulated in a positive fashion by phosphorylation at tyrosine 394 (Y394) XREF_BIBR . Consistent with the in vitro kinase activities noted above, the level of pY394 as demonstrated by immunoblot was comparable between WT and RhoH-deficient LN T cells ( XREF_FIG ). CD3zeta expression level was lower in Rhoh -/-  thymocytes than WT ( XREF_FIG ) due to the defective T cell development in Rhoh -/-  mice with most Rhoh -/-  thymocytes showing immature phenotype XREF_BIBR . Published data has shown that CD3zeta expression is higher in single-positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells than in immature thymocytes XREF_BIBR . These data suggest that while TCR signaling is abnormal, activation of Lck per se is not affected by loss of RhoH.\n\n\n\nRhoH requirement for co-recruitment of Lck and ZAP-70 to the immunologic synapse.\n\nThe interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) results in the formation of the immunological synapse (IS). ZAP-70 has been reported to promote CD3zeta phosphorylation by recruiting Lck to TCR complex in a kinase activity-independent manner XREF_BIBR . Both Lck and ZAP-70 have been shown to translocate to microclusters of receptors and signaling molecules in the peripheral regions of the T-APC interface during initiation of the TCR activation signal. The clusters then form a central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Consistent with these previous observations, after conjugation with APCs we found in WT CD8 +  cells that Lck translocated to the IS where it co-localized with ZAP-70 ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, recruitment of both Lck and ZAP-70 to the IS was defective in Rhoh -/-  T cells upon APC conjugation ( XREF_FIG ). This defect in IS localization was still present for up to 30 minutes after conjugation. Actin polymerization is critical for the formation of the IS by modulating the movement of molecules and lipid rafts XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , and is important for integrin-dependent adhesion between T cell and APC XREF_BIBR . Because Rho GTPases are known to be major regulators of actin polymerization, cytoskeleton assembly and integrin function, we examined the effect of RhoH-deficiency on actin polymerization in the IS. Actin polymerization was normal at the T-APC contact site in RhoH-deficient CD8 +  T cells ( XREF_FIG ), while other markers such as CD8 and the TCRbeta chain localize to the IS (data not shown). These data suggest that the defect in Lck and ZAP-70 translocation in RhoH-deficient T cells is not due to secondary effects on actin polymerization.\n\n\n\nSubcellular localization of Lck, CD3zeta, ZAP-70 and RhoH.\n\nEngagement of the TCR induces the translocation of several molecules such as Lck, ZAP-70 and CD3zeta to the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction of T cells that contains lipid rafts XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . For further biochemical studies of the role of RhoH in Lck/ZAP-70/CD3zeta complex subcellular translocation, we expressed HA-tagged RhoH in Jurkat T cells. As measured by immunoblot, anti-CD3epsilon antibody stimulation led to the translocation of both HA-RhoH and ZAP-70 to the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction (31.47+/-2.7% to 46.34+/-4.08%, RhoH, unstimulated vs stimulated p<0.01; 11.93+/-2.29% to 24+/-4.92%, ZAP-70, unstimulated vs stimulated p<0.02; mean+/-SD; N=3) with a significant amount of ZAP-70-bound HA-RhoH ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nSince ZAP-70 is defective in translocation to the TCR complex and the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction in RhoH-deficient T cells XREF_BIBR , we next analyzed the association of ZAP-70 and Lck in different subcellular fractions by immunoprecipitation experiments. ZAP-70 co-immunoprecipitated with Lck in the detergent-soluble membrane fraction of transfected Jurkat T cells without stimulation. Treatment with anti-CD3epsilon Ab enhanced the association of ZAP-70 with Lck in the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble membrane fraction (upper panel in  XREF_FIG ). As expected from previous studies most of the complex remained in the detergent-soluble membrane fraction. Since Lck phosphorylates CD3zeta and phospho-CD3zeta recruits ZAP-70 to TCR complex to activate downstream signaling molecules XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  we investigated the possible interactions of Lck with RhoH and CD3zeta. After anti-CD3epsilon stimulation most CD3zeta-bound ZAP-70 was detected in the detergent-insoluble membrane ( XREF_FIG  B, lower panel). In these studies, fully phosphorylated CD3zeta (p23) localized mostly to the detergent-insoluble membrane ( XREF_FIG , lower panel) and Lck co-immunoprecipitated primarily with the phosphorylated form of CD3zeta in anti-CD3epsilon stimulated cells. RhoH together with CD3zeta was associated with Lck and ZAP-70 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis after anti-CD3epsilon stimulation. Lck also co-immunoprecipitated with HA-RhoH in the detergent-soluble membrane fraction after anti-CD3epsilon Ab stimulation ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nEnhancement of ZAP-70/RhoH complex formation by Lck.\n\nBinding of ZAP-70 to the ITAM motifs of CD3zeta has been suggested to induce a conformational change of ZAP-70 that facilitates the phosphorylation of Tyr315 and Tyr319 in interdomain B of ZAP-70 XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . These phosphorylation events establish the active conformation of ZAP70. We have previously shown that RhoH associates with ZAP-70 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner XREF_BIBR . To further study the potential formation of multi-protein complexes containing RhoH, we transfected HEK293 cells with RhoH, ZAP-70 and a constitutive active mutant of Lck (CA-Lck). Exogenously-expressed RhoH did not affect the association of ZAP-70 and Lck ( XREF_FIG , upper panel, lane 4 vs lane 5 and summarized in C) or the phosphorylation on Tyr319 and Tyr493 of ZAP-70 by CA-Lck ( XREF_FIG , lane 4 vs lane 5). CA-Lck alone did not phosphorylate RhoH to the same level as co-expression of CA-Lck and ZAP-70( XREF_FIG , lower panel, lane 2 vs lane 4 and C). Expression of CA-Lck, ZAP-70 and RhoH together enhanced the interaction of ZAP-70 with RhoH and the phosphorylation of RhoH ( XREF_FIG , upper panel, lane 4 and lower panel and C). These data and the fact that RhoH did not co-immunoprecipitate with Lck in the absence of ZAP-70 suggest that Lck does not interact directly with RhoH in the absence of ZAP-70.\n\nSince CA-Lck alone did not phosphorylate RhoH efficiently, we next investigated whether ZAP-70 could phosphorylate RhoH with or without expression of Lck. As noted above, co-expression of CA-Lck, ZAP-70 and RhoH led to increased phosphorylation of RhoH which is immunoprecipitated with ZAP-70 ( XREF_FIG , lane 3). A co-expressed kinase-dead mutant of Lck (KD-Lck) and ZAP-70 did not complex with RhoH and was not associated with phosphorylation of RhoH ( XREF_FIG , lane 4). While co-expression of a kinase-dead ZAP-70 mutant (KA-ZAP-70) with CA-Lck could still lead to increased phosphorylation of RhoH, CA-Lck did not enhance the association of ZAP-70 with RhoH and KA-ZAP-70 also showed lower affinity to CA-Lck. ( XREF_FIG , lane 5). These data suggest that the kinase activities of both ZAP-70 and Lck are required for the association of RhoH with ZAP-70 and efficient phosphorylation of RhoH.\n\nWe next investigated whether Lck and ZAP-70 activity is required for the association of ZAP-70 with RhoH and phosphorylation of RhoH in T cells ( XREF_FIG ). Expression of CA-Lck in Jurkat T cells induced the phosphorylation of ZAP-70, CD3zeta, and RhoH. CA-Lck also enhanced the association of ZAP-70 with RhoH ( XREF_FIG , lane 5 vs. lane 1). In contrast, KD-Lck inhibited the phosphorylation of CD3zeta, ZAP-70, and RhoH ( XREF_FIG , lane 3) and reduced the association of RhoH with ZAP70 ( XREF_FIG , lane 3 vs lane 6). Jurkat T cells expressing a constitutive active ZAP-70 mutant (AA-ZAP-70) showed enhanced association between RhoH and ZAP-70, but not phosphorylation of RhoH ( XREF_FIG , lane 4 vs lane 1). AA-ZAP-70 induced the CD3zeta phosphorylation and ZAP-70/Lck complex formation. (KA-ZAP-70) did not alter the phosphorylation of RhoH and CD3zeta ( XREF_FIG ). As noted in HEK293 cells, both CA-Lck and AA-ZAP-70 enhanced the co-association of ZAP-70/RhoH/CD3zeta complex formation, but KA-ZAP-70 inhibited ZAP-70/Lck association in Jurkat T cells as well as HEK293 cells ( XREF_FIG  &  XREF_FIG ). These data suggest that Lck phosphorylates RhoH and CD3zeta through the interaction with functional ZAP-70.\n\n\n\nMyristoylation sequence tagged ZAP-70 can partially rescue the defective TCR signaling and thymic development in Rhoh -/-  thymocytes.\n\nTransient or stable membrane association of ZAP-70 mediated by the membrane-permeable synthetic ligand FK1012A or by a myristoylation sequence -tagged ZAP70 (Myr-ZAP-70) can activate downstream signaling of TCR XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Since ZAP-70 does not translocate to the TCR complex in Rho-deficient T cells, to determine if defective T cell development in Rhoh -/-  mice was due to defective ZAP-70 membrane localization, we generated a retroviral vector expressing Myr-ZAP-70 or control vector and utilized these vectors to transduce Rhoh-/- low density bone marrow cells (LDBM). First to determine the functional consequences of Myr-ZAP-70, we transduced Ba/F3 cells. Expression of the Myr-ZAP-70 in Ba/F3 cells led to an increase in the proportion of ZAP-70 protein in the detergent-soluble (27% to 40%) and detergent-insoluble (6% to 22%) membrane fractions of these cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). We subsequently compared the subcellular localization of Myr-ZAP-70 with WT-ZAP-70 in the transduced LDBM cells. Most Myr-ZAP-70 was localized to the plasma membrane in these transduced cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nNext, we analyzed the engraftment and T cell development of Myr-ZAP-70-expressing Rhoh -/-  bone marrow cells transplanted into Rag2 -/-  mice. Rhoh -/-  bone marrow (BM) cells were transduced with a bi-cistronic retroviral vector co-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and HA-RhoH, Myr-ZAP-70 or EGFP alone (as control). Transduced and EGFP + -sorted BM cells were transplanted via intravenous injection into the sub-lethally irradiated Rag2-deficient recipient mice. Development of CD8 single positive (SP) thymocytes at 8 weeks post-transplantation in Rag2 -/-  mice infused with Myr-ZAP-70-transduced RhoH -/-  BM cells was significantly increased compared with mice transplanted with Rhoh -/-  BM cells transduced with the empty-vector and reached levels equivalent to mice transplanted with cells transduced and expressing the RhoH cDNA ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, there was a trend toward correction of CD4 SP thymocytes in these mice, although this correction did not reach statistical significance (2.39+/-0.88 vs 16.75+/-14.25x10 6 ; CD4 SP, mean +/- SD; EGFP vs Myr-ZAP-70; N=3). Total thymic cellularity was also increased in mice transplanted with Myr-ZAP-70-transduced Rhoh -/-  BM cells (44.6+/-3.7x10 6 /mouse vs 104.8+/-45.6x10 6 ; mean +/- SD; EGFP vs Myr-ZAP-70; N=3; p<0.05).\n\nWe next investigated whether TCR signaling was corrected in Rhoh -/-  thymocytes expressing Myr-ZAP-70. As previously noted XREF_BIBR , we confirmed that Rhoh -/-  thymocytes showed impaired activation of LAT, CD3zeta and p44/42 ( XREF_FIG ), all molecules involved in TCR signaling. Expression of Myr-ZAP-70 partially restored the activation of these molecules after anti-CD3/28 Abs stimulation. While we could not detect the phosphorylation of CD3zeta and LAT after anti-CD3/28 Abs stimulation in Rhoh -/-  thymocytes expressing EGFP alone, expession of Myr-ZAP-70 in Rhoh -/-  thymocytes led to increased phosphorylation of CD3zeta and LAT ( XREF_FIG ). To examine whether the defective translocation of Lck to the immunologic synapse was corrected in Rhoh -/-  T cells expressing Myr-ZAP-70, we used anti-CD3/CD28 conjugated microbeads to activate T cells and induce IS formation XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . We transduced Rhoh-/- lymph node (LN) T cells with retroviruses co-expressing EGFP and Myr-ZAP-70 or EGFP alone. EGFP +  sorted LN T cells were incubated with anti-CD3epsilon and CD28 Abs, and then conjugated with Dynabeads. Lck was polarized towards the microbead interface of Rhoh -/-  T cells expressing Myr-ZAP-70, while Lck was widely dispersed over the membrane of Rhoh -/-  T cells expressing only EGFP ( XREF_FIG ). The association of ZAP-70 with the T cell membrane was enhanced by expression of Myr-ZAP-70 compared with T cells expressing EGFP alone ( XREF_FIG ). These data demonstrate that RhoH functions as an adaptor for ZAP-70 to facilitate the translocation of Lck into the TCR complex and membrane-targeted ZAP-70 can partially correct the defective TCR signaling in Rhoh -/-  T cells.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nRhoH is an hematopoietic-specific GTPase-deficient GTPase of the RhoE family first identified as a fusion of LAZ3/BCL6 in non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) XREF_BIBR . Subsequently, RhoH has been found to be mutated in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  and in AIDS-associated NHL XREF_BIBR , although the pathophysiological relevance of these findings are still unknown. Due to the presence of alternative residues at the highly conserved amino acids analogous to positions 12 and 61 of the Ras proteins regulating GTPase activity, RhoH remains GTP bound. Thus, the cellular activity and function of RhoH has been hypothesized to be dependent on protein levels in the cell.\n\nPrevious studies have implicated RhoH in T cell development and TCR signaling, inside-out integrin signaling and adhesion in T cells and antagonism of the activity of the Rac GTPase pathways in cells of hematopoietic lineages XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Using gene-targeted mice deficient in RhoH, we have previously demonstrated defective thymocyte development, positive and negative selection and TCR signaling. Rhoh -/-  mice have T lymphopenia and demonstrate reduced TCR-induced T cell proliferation in vitro. Proteomic studies demonstrated that RhoH interacts with ZAP-70 in TCR signaling, providing an initial insight into the molecular mechanism of defective T cell signaling in Rhoh -/-  cells.\n\nHere we show that RhoH plays a critical role in facilitating the localization of multiple TCR signaling components-likely via the ZAP-70 interaction-to the membrane, particularly the detergent insoluble fraction of the membrane that contains lipid rafts. Lck and ZAP-70 have been shown to translocate to microclusters of receptors and signaling molecules in the peripheral regions of the T-APC interface within lipid rafts during initiation of the TCR activation signal. The clusters form a central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . In addition, ZAP-70 has been reported to promote CD3zeta phosphorylation by recruiting Lck to TCR complex in a kinase activity-independent manner XREF_BIBR . In this regard, although Lck kinase activity appears normal in the absence of RhoH, here we demonstrate the Rhoh -/-  T cells show defective ZAP-70 and Lck localization to the IS and defective downstream signaling of the TCR pathway. Our studies demonstrate protein interactions between Lck, ZAP-70 and RhoH and that the translocation of both ZAP-70 and Lck to the IS is decreased in Rhoh -/-  T cells. Thus, RhoH appears to be involved in the coordinated movement of proteins in the IS. We are currently studying which domains in addition to the ITAM-like motifs of RhoH are critical for these interactions.\n\nPrevious studies have implicated the translocation of Lck, ZAP-70 and the TCR into the IS in effective TCR signaling  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Binding of ZAP-70 to ITAM motifs of CD3zeta has been suggested to induce a conformational change of ZAP-70 to facilitate the phosphorylation of Tyr315 and Tyr319 in interdomain B of ZAP-70, which establishes and stabilizes the active conformation of ZAP-70 XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . We have previously shown that RhoH associates with ZAP-70 in phosphorylation-dependent manner XREF_BIBR . In the studies reported here, exogenously-expressed RhoH alone did not affect the association of ZAP-70 and Lck or the phosphorylation of ZAP-70 on Tyr319 and 493 of ZAP-70 by Lck. However, expression of CA-Lck and functional ZAP-70 together enhanced the interaction of ZAP-70 with RhoH and the phosphorylation of RhoH. The motifs involved in these interactions are currently under additional investigations. RhoH-dependent localization of Lck to the IS via ZAP-70 would suggest that ZAP-70 can function both upstream and downstream of Lck in the localization of TCR signaling components and phosphorylation of CD3zeta. This is consistent with previous reports that TCR-induced phosphorylation of CD3zeta is reduced in ZAP-70 -/-  mice, suggesting a role for ZAP-70 as an upstream facilitator of Lck localization and function XREF_BIBR .\n\nTaken together, these data suggest that RhoH may act as an adaptor molecule for ZAP-70 and Lck recruitment which, in turn, phosphorylates RhoH to enhance the heterotrimeric association of these molecules. In support of this hypothesis, CA-Lck is required for the activation of ZAP-70 and co-expression of CA-Lck and ZAP-70 enhanced the phosphorylation and binding affinity of RhoH to ZAP-70. Since CA-Lck alone did not phosphorylate RhoH efficiently, we also investigated the potential role of ZAP-70 in RhoH phosphorylation. Co-expression of kinase-dead Lck and ZAP-70 did not result in measurable phosphorylation of RhoH. However, a constitutive active mutant of Lck induced phosphorylation of RhoH and enhanced interaction among ZAP-70/Lck/RhoH in Jurkat T cells, whereas kinase-dead Lck inhibited the phosphorylation of RhoH and CD3zeta. Constitutive active ZAP-70 also enhanced ZAP-70/RhoH complex formation through Lck activation because AA-ZAP-70 showed enhanced CD3zeta phosphorylation and association with Lck in Jurkat T cells. Co-expression of kinase-dead ZAP-70 with CA-Lck resulted in reduced phosphorylation of RhoH, and the KA-ZAP-70 did not co-immunoprecipitate with RhoH and showed lower binding affinity to Lck. These data suggest that functional ZAP-70 is required for the Lck-mediated RhoH phosphorylation and optimal association of RhoH with ZAP-70.\n\nSupporting a critical role for RhoH in functionally important localization of ZAP-70 to the membrane, anti-CD3/28 Abs-induced phosphorylation of CD3zeta and LAT was partially restored in Rhoh -/-  thymocytes expressing Myr-ZAP-70. As expected, a higher proportion of Myr-ZAP-70 compared with wild-type ZAP-70 showed association with the cell membrane in T cells. Myr-ZAP-70 partially rescued in thymocyte development and TCR signaling in the absence of RhoH. Membrane-bound ZAP-70 can activate TCR minimally without stimuli, but still requires functional Lck activity  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Since Myr-ZAP-70 can partially rescue the thymocyte development and TCR signaling in Rhoh -/-  cells, we suggest that RhoH function is required for the membrane localization of ZAP-70, particularly to the IS. In the experiments reported here, there could be two reasons why Myr-ZAP-70 did not completely restore the TCR signaling in Rhoh -/-  cells completely. First, the sustained TCR activation by membrane-bound ZAP-70 might induce a refractory state that reduces TCR signaling efficiency as previously reported XREF_BIBR . Second, src myristoylation sequence broadly localizes ZAP-70 to the membrane, and not to specific TCR signaling regions ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) XREF_BIBR . In Rhoh -/-  T cells expressing Myr-ZAP-70, Lck was polarized towards the interface of cells and microbeads coated with anti-CD3epsilon and anti-CD28 antibodies, while Lck remained dispersed over the entire membrane in Rhoh -/-  T cells expressing only EGFP. These data strongly suggest that RhoH functions with ZAP-70 to also facilitate the translocation of Lck into the TCR complex. Taken together with the data showing partial rescue of T cell development after Rhoh-/- cells expressing Myr-ZAP-70 are transferred into Rag2-/- mice, these data suggest that this function of RhoH is physiologically important.\n\nOther investigators have confirmed that RhoH promotes the ZAP70-dependent phosphorylation of the LAT signalosome XREF_BIBR . Although they did not show defective localization and activation of ZAP-70, there was complete loss of CD3zeta phosphorylation XREF_BIBR . One possibility to explain the difference in ZAP-70 phosphorylation in these studies is that this group stimulated T cells using CD3 and CD4 co-crosslinking, which could lead to the direct recruitment of Lck.\n\nAltogether, these data suggest that Lck/ZAP-70 complex may facilitate the phosphorylation of RhoH, which then enhances the interaction between ZAP-70 and RhoH. The enhanced association between RhoH and ZAP-70 may then facilitate the localization of Lck/ZAP-70 to the TCR complex leading to the known role of these proteins in phosphorylation of CD3zeta. After this, ZAP-70 bound to CD3zeta, ZAP-70/CD3zeta or ZAP-70/RhoH moves to the detergent-insoluble fraction or IS region. Overall, while RhoH appears to regulate Rac activity in some hematopoietic cell lines and in primary hematopoietic cells, the data presented here and the differences in T cell phenotypes of Rhoh -/- , Rac1 -/- ;Rac2 -/- , ZAP-70 -/-  and Vav1 -/-  (reviewed in Wang and Zheng XREF_BIBR ) mice suggest that RhoH functioning in TCR signaling and T cell development is more complicated and in part related to its function as an adaptor molecule that affects localization of both ZAP-70 and Lck in the IS. This defines a novel function of Rho GTPases.\n\n",
