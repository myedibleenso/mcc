      "text":"Nitric oxide induces MUC5AC mucin in respiratory epithelial cells through PKC and ERK dependent pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground.\n\nNitric oxide (NO) is generally increased during inflammatory airway diseases. This increased NO stimulates the secretion of mucin from the goblet cell and submucosal glands but the mechanism is still unknown precisely. In this study, we investigated potential signaling pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the NO-induced MUC5AC mucin gene and protein expression in A549 cells.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\nThe transcriptional activity of MUC5AC promoter was maximal at the concentration of 0.1 mM NOR-1 for 1 hour incubation in transfected A549 cells. (+/-)-(E)-methyl-2-((E)-hydroxyimino)-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexenamide (NOR-1) markedly displaced the protein kinase C (PKC)alpha and PKCdelta from the cytosol to the membrane. Furthermore, the PKC-alpha,betainhibitors, GO6976 (10 nM) and PKCdelta inhibitors, rottlerin (4 muM) inhibited the NOR-1 induced migration of PKCalpha and PKCdelta respectively. NOR-1 also markedly increased the MUC5AC promoter activity and mRNA expression, mucin synthesis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The PKC inhibitors also inhibited the NOR-1 induced MUC5AC mRNA and MUC5AC protein synthesis by inhibiting the activation of PKCalpha and PKCdelta with ERK1/2 pathways.\n\n\n\nConclusion.\n\nExogenous NO induced the MUC5AC mucin gene and protein through the PKCalpha and PKCdelta - ERK pathways in A549 cells. Inhibition of PKC attenuated NO-mediated MUC5AC mucin synthesis. In view of this findings, PKC inhibitors might be useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis patients where NO and mucus are increased in the bronchial airways.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground.\n\nProduction of NO is generally increased during inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma or bronchiectasis, or after exposure to irritant gases such as ozone [ XREF_BIBR ]. NO is produced by the action of NO synthase (NOS) on L-arginine and has many physiological and pathological roles. In chronic lower airway disease, the role of NO include pulmonary vasodilation, brochodilation, regulation of ciliary beat frequency and mucus production [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] and NOS is found in raised quantities in the airway epithelium of asthmatic patients[ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nGoblet cell hyperplasia and metaplasia are well established hallmarks of the airways of cigarette smokers, with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Enhanced epithelial mucin expression is believed to be the rate limiting step for goblet cell metaplasia [ XREF_BIBR ]. Four gel forming mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC19) are found in the lung. Of these, MUC5AC and MUC5B are the major respiratory mucins present in secretions from goblet cells and sub-mucosal glands, respectively [ XREF_BIBR ]. MUC5AC has been shown to be stimulated by a wide variety of stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-9, IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ], neutrophil elastase [ XREF_BIBR ], epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands [ XREF_BIBR ], air pollutants [ XREF_BIBR ] and bacterial products [ XREF_BIBR ]. Oxidants in cigarette smoke and generated from asbestos fibers activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades in lung epithelial cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. Airway MUC5AC mucin is transcriptionally upregulated by cigarette smoke and is mediated by an AP-1 containing response element binding JunD and Fra-1 [ XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, it is reported that PKC is involved in TNF-alpha or bacterial components induced MUC2 and MUC5AC overexpression in airway and middle ear epithelial cells or goblet cells [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nNO donation by isosorbide dinitrate increased MUC5AC mucin secretion in the goblet cell line HT29-MTX [ XREF_BIBR ] but suppressed chemokine production in keratinocytes [ XREF_BIBR ]. There have been only a few studies investigating the role of NO in airway mucus secretion and much is still unknown about the role of PKC and MAPK pathways during upregulation of MUC5AC mucin secretion after donation of NO to the bronchial epithelial cells. In this study, we evaluated the effect of NO release on MUC5AC mucin production and the cell-signaling pathways involved in its regulation in the cell line A549. A549, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, which has been used extensively as a model of respiratory epithelium and expresses both MUC5AC mRNA and glycoprotein [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn this study, we examined effects of NO on MUC5AC mucin synthesis and PKC-mediated second messenger pathways that may be involved in physiological functions of airway epithelium. Our results suggest that the PKC inhibitors inhibit the MUC5AC mRNA expression and mucin synthesis through inhibiting the PKCalpha and PKCdelta-ERK1/2-MUC5AC promoter pathways during donation of NO to the A549 cells.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nNO concentration in A549 cells culture media.\n\nThe concentrations of NO in the culture medium of A549 cells after incubation with the synthetic NO donors, NOR-1 for 3 hours were well correlated the concentrations of NOR-1                  . The NO concentrations in the culture medium were quantified by measuring nitrite and nitrate concentrations using the Greiss reaction [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\n\n\nEffect of NO donation on MUC5AC promoter activity.\n\nTo determine whether NO was regulating MUC5AC transcription, we transfected A549 cells with a luciferase reporter pGL3-basic vector containing the 3.7 kb 5' flanking region from the transcription start site of the human MUC5AC promoter. NOR-1 increased the transcriptional activity of MUC5AC promoter most markedly at the concentration of 0.1 mM                     and 60 minute incubation                    . MUC5AC transcriptional activity was increased after stimulation with NOR-1 for one hour between 0.1 mM and 1 mM concentrations                    .\n\n\n\nActivation of PKC isoforms by NOR-1.\n\nTo confirm the role of PKC activation in the effect of NO on MUC5AC mucin synthesis in A549 cells, we assessed the effects of NOR-1 on PKCalpha. Activation of PKCalpha was measured by assessing the distribution of the enzyme between cytosolic and membrane fractions using immunoblotting, because translocation of the enzyme from the cytosolic fraction to the membrane fraction correlates with activation of the enzyme. As shown in Figure  XREF_FIG , incubation with NOR-1 for one hour resulted in significant translocation of PKCalpha from the cytosolic fraction to membrane fraction. The translocation of PKCalpha was more prominent during incubation with 1 muM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator. Next, we tested the effect of NOR-1 on PKC isoforms expression in A549 cells. As shown in figure  XREF_FIG , 0.5 mM NOR-1 induced migration of PKCalpha and PKCdelta from the cytosol to the membrane. The coincubation with PKCalpha,betainhibitors, GO6976 (10 nM) and PKCdelta inhibitors, rottlerin (4 muM) inhibited the NOR-1 induced migration of PKCalpha and PKCdelta respectively. NOR-1 induced migration of PKCalpha and PKCdelta were also inhibited by 0.5 uM calphostin C, a general PKC inhibitor.\n\n\n\nEffect of NOR-1 and PKC inhibitors on mucin secretion.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure  XREF_FIG , NOR-1 stimulated MUC5AC mucin synthesis by A549 cells. The increased mucin synthesis elicited by the NOR-1 was reversed with the preincubation with GO6976, rottlerin and calphostin-C. No cytotoxic effects were observed.\n\n\n\nNOR-1 phosphorylated ERK1/2 but not P38 MAPK.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure  XREF_FIG , exposure of A549 cells to NOR-1 caused a phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and this increased phosphorylation was inhibited with PD98059 (a specific MEK inhibitor), and PKC inhibitors (GO6976, rottlerin and calphostin C). However, the effects of NOR-1 on P38 MAPK phosphorylation was not noted.\n\n\n\nEffect of NOR-1 and PKC inhibitors on MUC5AC mRNA expression.\n\nNOR-1 increased the MUC5AC mRNA expression and the PKC inhibitors (GO6976, rottlerin and calphostin C) inhibited NOR-1 induced MUC5AC mRNA expression                    .\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nThe present study clearly demonstrates a potent stimulatory effects of NO donor on MUC5AC mucin secretion from A549 cells. Activation of the PKCalpha and PKCdelta with ERK1/2 mediated NO donor induced MUC5AC mucin gene expression and mucin synthesis. We used NOR-1 as a NO donor which releases NO with a more rapid kinetics [ XREF_BIBR ]. NO donors suppress chemokine production by inhibiting nuclear factor-kB and STAT-1 [ XREF_BIBR ]. The role of NO in the regulation of inflammatory responses has been extensively investigated. However, there have been only a few studies investigating the role of NO in mucus secretion with conflicting results. On the one hand, NO inhibited mucus secretion in ferret trachea in vitro [ XREF_BIBR ] and on the other hand, it had a stimulatory role in the mucus secretion in isolated submucosal gland from feline trachea [ XREF_BIBR ] or it had no effect on the mucus secretion in the rat trachea [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nProtein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases with at least 10 different isoforms [ XREF_BIBR ]. The PKC family contains three types of isoforms; classical (cPKCs: alpha, beta 1 , beta 2 , gamma), novel (nPKCs: delta, epsilon, eta, theta, mu), and atypical (aPKCs: xi, iota/lambda). The classical isoforms are calcium and phorbol ester-activated, the novel are calcium-insensitive but activated by phorbol esters, and the atypical isoforms are both calcium and phorbol ester-insensitive, with all isofoms activated by phosphatidyl serine[ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nThe interaction between NO and PKC has been the subject of many studies, with most focused on the role of PKC in the regulation of NO production [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. With regard to effects of NO on PKC, controversial results exist. NO inactivates PKC in a macrophage cell line [ XREF_BIBR ]. On the other hand, NO activates PKC in hepatocytes [ XREF_BIBR ], smooth muscle cells [ XREF_BIBR ], and kidney cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, NO was shown to mediate the stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC), a typical upstream step for PKC activation, by oxidant stress [ XREF_BIBR ]. In a lot of inflammatory airway diseases, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is involved in bronchoconstriction, pulmonary edema, and production of cytokines and lipid mediators. TNF-alpha stimulates mucin secretion via an intracellular pathway that appears to involve endogenously produced NO [ XREF_BIBR ]. NO mediates many of its intracellular effects through activation of soluble guanyl cyclase with subsequent increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production [ XREF_BIBR ]. Recently NO has also been demonstrated in goblet cells to upregulate MUC5AC production [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn this study, NOR-1 directly increased the transcriptional activity of transfected MUC5AC promoter, indicating that NO-induced upregulation of MUC5AC mRNA occurs at the transcriptional level. NOR-1 also moved the PKCalpha and PKCdelta from the cytosol to the membrane and this intracellular activation of PKC was inhibited by PKCalpha inhibitor and PKCdelta inhibitor.\n\nInvolvement of PKC in secretion of airway mucin in response to various stimuli has been indicated previously [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. The specific PKC isoenzymes that contribute to PKC-induced mucin secretion have not been determined, although PKCxi and PKCdelta have been suggested as potential candidates [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Recently human neutrophil elastase has been found to induce mucin secretion through a PKCdelta-mediated mechanism in human bronchial epithelial cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. In this paper, we also found that the MUC5AC mucin synthesis by NOR-1 was inhibited by PKC inhibitors. As illustrated in figure  XREF_FIG , NOR-1 increased the MUC5AC mRNA expression and this increased expression was nearly completely inhibited by PKC inhibitors. The calphostin C; a specific PKC inhibitor, rottlerin; a PKCdelta/theta inhibitor, GO6976; a PKCalpha/beta inhibitor all inhibited the NOR-1 induced MUC5AC mRNA expression, MUC5AC mucin synthesis and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) phosphorylations. Calphostin C is a specific PKC inhibitor that binds to the diacylglycerol (DAG) binding site of the enzyme to block its activity [ XREF_BIBR ]. Our findings suggested that NO activated both alpha and delta forms of PKC which in turn involved in MUC5AC mucin synthesis in A549 cells. When we examined the translocation of PKC isoforms in response to NOR-1, NOR-1 activated the PKCalpha and PKCdelta but not PKCgamma and PKCepsilon                    . As expected, the activation of PKCalpha by NOR-1 was inhibited by GO6976 and the activation of PKCdelta by NOR-1 was inhibited by rottlerin. Calphostin C inhibited the NOR-1 induced activation of both PKCalpha and PKCdelta.\n\nPhorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), are important inflammatory stimuli that have been shown to modulate diverse cellular events through PKC activation [ XREF_BIBR ]. PMA induced an increase in MUC2 gene expression and this induction involved PKC, was Ras and Raf dependent, required activation of mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, and led to the activation of the cis-acting transcription factor, NF-kB [ XREF_BIBR ]. MUC5AC mucin was also induced by PMA through the Ras-Raf-MEK/ERK and specificity protein (Sp) 1 transcription factor dependent pathways [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nThe mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades consist of serine threonine kinases that are sequentially phosphorylated by upstream kinases (MAPKKK, MAPKK) and subdivided into three major pathways: ERKs, c-Jun-NH 2 -terminal kinases (JNKs 1, 2, and 3) (also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases), and p38 kinases [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. MAPK cascades can be initiated by activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or other factors stimulating phosphorylation of upstream MAPKKK and MAPKK (MEK). Oxidative stress causes activation of EGFR-MEK-ERK1/2 pathways, resulting in mucin synthesis [ XREF_BIBR ]. Recent studies have demonstrated cross-talk between p38 MAP kinase and ERK [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. p38 MAP kinases are activated by a variety of agents, including environmental stress (e.g., reactive oxygen species, UV radiation), cytokines (e.g., interleukin [IL]-1beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), or growth factors such as EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn this study, we found that NO donation by NOR-1 activated ERK1/2 but not p38 and this ERK1/2 activation was inhibited by several types of PKC inhibitors and by MEK inhibitor, PD98059                    . These findings suggest that NO induced MUC5AC mucin through the PKC-MEK-ERK1/2 pathways in A549 cells. According to previous reports on respiratory tract and colon epithelial cells, production of mucin induced by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria is dependent on tyrosine kinase such as the MEK1/2-MAPK signalling pathway [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. This tyrosine kinase signal results in the activation of NF-kB in respiratory tract epithelial cells, which are involved in the overproduction of mucin induced by Psudomonas aeruginosa [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nToday, it is widely accepted that NO plays an important role in airway function. NO is an important mediator in the lung and has been shown to be associated with inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, overproduction of mucus with altered rheologic properties is an important factor in the morbidity and mortality of asthma and chronic bronchitis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Our results suggest that PKC inhibitors may be a promising new agents for the treatment of mucin hypersecretion in inflammatory airway diseases where NO is highly produced.\n\n\n\nAbbreviations.\n\nNOR1 = (+/-)-(E)-methyl-2-((E)-hydroxyimino)-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexenamide; NO = nitric oxide; PKC = protein kinase C; ELISA = enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; TNF-alpha = tumor necrosis factor alpha; EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK = extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PMA = Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate\n\n",
