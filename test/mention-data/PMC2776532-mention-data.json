      "text":"Multiple Functions of Nm23-H1 Are Regulated by Oxido-Reduction System.\n\n\n\nNucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK, Nm23), a housekeeping enzyme, is known to be a multifunctional protein, acting as a metastasis suppressor, transactivation activity on c-myc, and regulating endocytosis. The cellular mechanisms regulating Nm23 functions are poorly understood. In this study, we identified the modifications and interacting proteins of Nm23-H1 in response to oxidative stress. We found that Cys109 in Nm23-H1 is oxidized to various oxidation states including intra- and inter-disulfide crosslinks, glutathionylation, and sulfonic acid formation in response to H 2 O 2  treatment both in vivo and in vitro. The cross-linking sites and modifications of oxidized Nm23-H1 were identified by peptide sequencing using UPLC-ESI-q-TOF tandem MS. Glutathionylation and oxidation of Cys109 inhibited the NDPK enzymatic activity of Nm23-H1. We also found that thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) is an interacting protein of Nm23-H1, and it binds specifically to oxidized Nm23-H1. Oxidized Nm23 is a substrate of NADPH-TrxR1-thioredoxin shuttle system, and the disulfide crosslinking is reversibly reduced and the enzymatic activity is recovered by this system. Oxidation of Cys109 in Nm23-H1 inhibited its metastatic suppressor activity as well as the enzymatic activities. The mutant, Nm23-H1 C109A, retained both the enzymatic and metastasis suppressor activities under oxidative stress. This suggests that key enzymatic and metastasis suppressor functions of Nm23-H1 are regulated by oxido-reduction of its Cys109.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nNucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK, Nm23), a housekeeping enzyme, is considered to be a tumor metastasis suppressor  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Nm23 is characterized by its reduced expression in melanoma cell lines having high metastatic potential  XREF_BIBR . Overexpression of cellular Nm23-H1 correlated with decreased metastasis potential of breast, melanoma, colon, and oral squamous cells  XREF_BIBR . Also, mutations of Nm23-H1 seen in some cancers including colorectal carcinoma, are associated with increased metastasis  XREF_BIBR .\n\nNm23 belongs to a family of structurally conserved proteins of NDP kinase catalyzing the transfer of terminal phosphate from nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to nucleoside diphosphate (NDP)  XREF_BIBR . There are eight known nm23 genes in the human genome, and two of them, Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2, have been the most widely studied. Nm23-H1 and -H2 are small proteins consisted with152 amino acids, and form homohexamers or heterohexamers  XREF_BIBR . Although they are highly homologous (88% amino acid identity), their cellular functions and localizations are different. Nm23-H1 is a putative metastasis suppressor of some tumor types  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , whereas Nm23-H2 binds to the nuclease-sensitive element of c-myc gene promoter, and transactivates its gene expression  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Both Nm23-H1 and -H2 proteins are found in the cytoplasm, but Nm23-H2 has also been detected in the nucleus  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR .\n\nStudies, performed to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the ability of Nm23-H1, to suppress metastasis, led to following observations. Nm23-H1 regulates some small G-proteins which play important roles in cell migration as a GTPase  XREF_BIBR . Nm23-H1 inhibits MAP kinase pathway by interacting with kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) scaffold protein. Nm23-H1 in its function as a protein kinase, forms a complex with KSR1 and phosphorylates it at Ser 392 and Ser 434, which results in blockade of Ras/MAPK pathway  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . And Nm23-H1 interacts with Tiam1, a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1, and down-regulates Tiam1-Rac1 signaling, implying that it affects remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton  XREF_BIBR . Palacios et al. demonstrated that constitutively activated ARF6 binds to Nm23-H1 and recruits Nm23-H1 to cell junction  XREF_BIBR . More recently, Nm23-H1 has been shown to interact with Dbl-1, an oncoprotein of the GEF family, thereby inhibiting the suppression of cell motility by Nm23-H1. Moreover, this interaction results in the loss of the ability of the Dbl-1 to function as a GEF for Cdc42  XREF_BIBR . However, how Nm23s exerts variety of cellular activities and how these activities are regulated, is not well understood.\n\nPost-translational modifications (PTMs) of Nm23 play key roles in many cellular functions and regulatory processes, by influencing cellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and biological activities of cellular proteins. The modifications of Nm23 caused by oxidative stresses were identified as disulfide crosslinking  XREF_BIBR . Cellular Nm23 is cross-linked by disulfide bond in response to H 2 O 2  treatment and is reversibly reduced by reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) or by some unknown cellular mechanism. H 2 O 2  inactivates NDP kinase activity of Nm23 by producing disulfide bonds which cause the dissociation of native hexameric structure to dimeric form. Intermolecular cross-linking sites between Cys109-Cys109 were identified by mass spectrometry. Even though Cys109 residue is not in the active site, oxido-reduction of this residue can regulate the enzymatic activity and the quaternary structure of Nm23. However, the cellular regulation of Nm23 was not clearly understood.\n\nAll organisms possess repair systems for removing damaged/oxidized molecules. Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) is a selenium-containing pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase, with mechanistic and sequence identity with glutathione reductases, including a conserved CVNVG redox catalytic site. TrxR catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of the redox protein thioredoxin (Trx), as well as of other endogenous and exogenous compounds. TrxRs are also named because of their ability to reduce oxidized Trx  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Mammalian Trxs are a family of small (12 kDa) redox proteins that undergo NADPH-dependent reduction mediated by TrxR and which in turn reduce oxidized cysteines on proteins. Trx1 performs many biological functions including supplying reducing equivalents to thioredoxin peroxidases and ribonucleotide reductase, regulating transcription factor activity, and the enzyme activity by heterodimer formation  XREF_BIBR . In this study, we identified the various oxidative modifications of cellular Nm23-H1 using UPLC-ESI-q-TOF tandem MS including S-glutathionylation of Cys109. The increase of protein glutathionylations are believed to be the cellular response to oxidative stress  XREF_BIBR . S-glutathionylation is a reversible post-translational modification and may proceed spontaneously by thiol-disulfide exchange or by reaction of a reduced protein-SH or GSH with an oxidized sulfhydryl  XREF_BIBR . And S-glutathionylation has been shown to be essential for the function of several proteins such as Ras, NF-1, c-jun, p50/NF-kappaB, actin and IkappaB kinase subunit beta (IKKbeta)  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . This modification inhibits NDPK activity of Nm23-H1. We also found TrxR to be an interacting protein of oxidized Nm23-H1 and that oxidized Nm23-H1 can be repaired by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. This suggests that Nm23-H1 can be a key molecule modified and regulated by ROS via NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. These results suggest that the biological function of Nm23-H1, as a house keeping enzyme, and as a tumor metastasis suppressor, is regulated by oxido-reduction of Nm23-H1 at a cysteine residue, not at its active site.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nCys109 in cellular Nm23-H1 is oxidatively modified.\n\nTo determine the cellular modifications of endogenous Nm23-H1 and -H2 by oxidative stress, cellular Nm23-H1 was co-purified with Nm23-H2 by immunoprecipitation using Nm23-H1 antibody ( XREF_FIG ) and various PTMs were analyzed using nanoAcquity(TM) UPLC(TM)/ESI/q-TOF tandem MS as described in methodology. MCF-7 breast cancer cells, non-invasive cell lines highly expressing Nm23, were exposed to control HBSS or 1 mM H 2 O 2  for 1 h at 37degreesC. The immuno-complexes were divided into 2 fractions. One fraction was separated on 12% non-reducing SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition and detected by silver-staining ( XREF_FIG ). Another fraction of samples was prepared for MS analysis without any staining after separation on 12% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition. Presumed Nm23 bands were excised with a scalpel on gel and confirmed as Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 by peptide sequencing with nanoAcquity(TM) UPLC(TM)/ESI/q-TOF tandem MS after trypsin digestion (data not shown). We examined the modification site and status of the modified peptides by peptide sequencing with MS/MS, employing SEMSA technology  XREF_BIBR  and MOD i  algorithm for PTM detection  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . As shown in  XREF_FIG , we detected various modifications at Cys109 of peptide  106 GDFCIQVGR 114  (993.4701 Da). Most of the free sulfhydryl of Cys109 was easily labeled with alkylating agent NEM or by generating acrylamide adduct in SDS-PAGE (Deltam/z=+71.0359 Da). But small fractions of Cys109 were oxidiatively modified to various states which included: sulfonic acid modification ( 109 CysSO 3 H, Deltam/z=+43.038 Da), cyanylation ( 109 CysSCN, Deltam/z=+24.9941 Da), glutathionylation ( 109 CysS-S-glutathione(ECG), Deltam/z=+305.0637 Da), cysteinylation ( 109 CysS-SCys, Deltam/z=+119.0121 Da), dehydroalanine (Deltam/z=-33.9821 Da), and disulfide bond formation with other cysteine residues ( 109 CysS-S-AN 4 CER, Deltam/z=+589.2075 Da:  109 CysS-S-ELGLWFHPEELVDYTS 145 CAQNWIYE, Deltam/z=+2939.2851 Da). Although these oxidative modifications constituted a minor fraction, compared to the NEM labeling, the precursor ion of each oxidative population was clearly identified in  XREF_FIG . Furthermore, these were confirmed in MS/MS spectra for peptide sequencing in  XREF_FIG . These results indicate that cellular Cys109 of Nm23-H1 is oxidized to various ways. Intriguingly, glutathionylation and sulfonic acid modification at Cys109 were discernibly increased in Nm23-H1 treated with H 2 O 2  than control, and semi-quantitative analyses of modified peptides were performed by quantifying the precursor ion intensities in LC chromatograms ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest that Cys109 plays a crucial role in response to oxidative stress through glutathionylation.\n\n\n\nGlutathionylation of Nm23-H1 occurred at Cys109 residue.\n\nTo confirm the glutathionylation of Cys109 in Nm23-H1, the glutathionylations of recombinant Nm23-H1s were examined by treating them with glutathione. Recombinant proteins of wild Nm23-H1 and C109A mutant were treated with 2.5 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG) or 5 mM reduced glutathione (GSH) for 1 h at 37degreesC. Each sample was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition and detected with coomassie blue staining ( XREF_FIG ). The original band of wild type Nm23-H1 with GSSG shifted to higher molecular weight. However, GSSG treatment did not affect the band profiles of C109A mutant. The shifted bands from wild type Nm23 were identified as products of glutathionylation at Cys109 by nanoAcquity(TM) UPLC(TM)/ESI-q-TOF tandem MS. Tandem MS spectra of glutathionylated peptides ( 106 GDFCIQVGR 114 ) from cellular and recombinant Nm23-H1 were compared in  XREF_FIG . The patterns of MS/MS spectra were typical and quite similar to the disulfide bond fragmentation even though the intensity of cellular Nm23 was lower than that of the recombinant one. MS/MS fragmentations of glutathionylated peptide were assigned in  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY . These results demonstrate that Cys109 of Nm23-H1 is easily glutathionylated by oxidized glutathione.\n\n\n\nGlutathionylated Nm23-H1 inhibits NDPK enzymatic activity.\n\nTo determine the effect of glutathionylation on the biological activity of Nm23-H1, we examined the NDPK activity of glutathionylated Nm23-H1. Recombinant Nm23-H1 was treated with 5.0 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG) for 30 min at 37degreesC. The product was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gel under non-reducing conditions and silver stained. Half of Nm23-H1 was glutathionylated (as shown in  XREF_FIG ), furthermore, the NDP kinase activity of Nm23 disappeared with glutathionylation ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that the glutathionylation of Cys109 of Nm23-H1 alters the structure of its active site and inhibits their enzymatic activity.\n\n\n\nOxidized Nm23 interacts with thioredoxin reductase in vivo.\n\nWe attempted to identify the proteins interacting with oxidized Nm23-H1 in order to understand how oxidized Nm23-H1 functions in vivo. Hela cells transiently overexpressing Flag-Nm23-H1 were exposed to 5 mM H 2 O 2  for 1 h and let stand for 6 h without H 2 O 2 . Hela cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Flag M2 agarose cross-linked affinity beads, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were separated on one dimensional gel electrophoresis and detected by silver staining ( XREF_FIG ) and by Western analysis using anti-Flag antibody ( XREF_FIG ). Flag-Nm23s were detected at 17 kDa and 34 kDa with silver staining ( XREF_FIG ) and confirmed by Western blotting ( XREF_FIG ). In addition to Nm23-H1, we detected a new band in the co-immunoprecipitates with oxidized Flag-Nm23-H1, but not with control Flag and control Flag-Nm23-H1 ( XREF_FIG ). This band was identified as thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1, NCBI accession number 2500118) ( XREF_FIG ), after subjecting it to in-gel digestion with trypsin and MALDI-TOF MS and nanoLC-ESI-q-TOF MS/MS, analysis. The identity of this protein binding to oxidized Nm23 as thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) was confirmed by Western analysis using anti-TrxR1 antibody ( XREF_FIG ). Thus oxidized Nm23-H1 seems to specifically interact with TrxR1 in vivo.\n\n\n\nOxidized Nm23 is a substrate of thioredoxin reductase 1- thioredoxin-NADPH system.\n\nThioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) is known enzyme to catalyze the reduction of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx), by transferring electrons from NADPH to the active-site disulfide of oxidized Trx. We suggest that oxidized Nm23-H1 may be a substrate of TrxR1 or Trx ( XREF_FIG ). To examine whether oxidized Nm23-H1 regulates the TrxR1 system, we monitored TrxR1 activity by measuring the conversion rate of NADPH to NADP in reaction mixtures containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 200 microM NADPH, and varying combinations of 80 nM rat TrxR1, 50 microM Trx and 100 microM Nm23-H1. The oxidation kinetics from NADPH to NADP +  was determined by measuring absorbance changes at 340 nm in various combinations of reaction components as shown ( XREF_FIG ). The changes of A 340  in control (A, G) and reduced Trx (B) by NADPH and TrxR1 were about -0.067, and in oxidized Trx (C) -0,073, which indicates the reduction of oxidized Trx through NADPH and TrxR1. When we added oxidized Nm23-H1 (D, E) to the mixture of NADPH, TrxR1 and reduced (D) or oxidized Trx (E), the absorbance changes observed were A 340 , -0.263 and -0.203 respectively. The velocity of the reaction in sample D using reduced Trx, is markedly faster in sample E using oxidized Trx, confirming that oxidized Nm23 is a substrate of Trx coupled with reduced Trx. On the other hand, reduced Nm23-H1 (F) cannot oxidize NADPH, indicating that oxidized Nm23 can be specifically reduced in NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. We examined the possibility of Nm23 as a direct substrate of TrxR as like Trx. When oxidized and reduced Nm23s were incubated with NADPH and TrxR without Trx, the absorbance decrease was negligible as with the control ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). This suggests that Nm23 is not a direct substrate of TrxR, and that Trx is necessary for reducing oxidized Nm23-H1. Thus it appears that oxidized Nm23 can be a substrate of Trx in NADPH-TrxR-Trx system and that oxidized Nm23-H1 can be reduced by the oxidative conversion of NADPH to NADP +  by electron donation.\n\nTo determine whether the Nm23-H1 reduced from its oxidized form by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system, remains functional, we examined the enzymatic activities of Nm23-H1 after incubating with TrxR1 and NADPH with and without Trx. As shown in  XREF_FIG , oxidized Nm23 has low enzymatic activity, but reduction of oxidized Nm23 by incubating it in NADPH-TrxR-Trx system recovered the enzymatic activity in a Trx concentration dependent manner. To examine which oxidized forms of Nm23-H1 are reduced by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system, various populations of oxidized Nm23-H1 protein profiles were analyzed with SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. We found that oxidized Nm23-H1 showed intra- and inter-disulfide bonds, and that intra- and specific inter-dimers of Nm23-H1 were reduced by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system ( XREF_FIG ). These results demonstrate that Nm23-H1 is easily oxidized to inactive forms, which can be readily reduced by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system to regain its cellular functions.\n\n\n\nOxidation of Nm23-H1 inhibit its metastasis suppressing ability.\n\nIt is well known that metastatic potential for breast cancer cells inversely correlates with their Nm23-H1 content  XREF_BIBR . To determine whether oxidation of cellular Nm23-H1 affects cell migration, we examined the invasion potential of breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, transiently transfected with Nm23-H1 C109A mutant. Here, MDA-MB-231, a highly invasive cell line, express lower levels of Nm23-H1 than MCF-7 cells, non-invasive cells ( XREF_FIG ). When we knocked down the Nm23-H1 with siRNA of Nm23-H1 in MCF-7 cells, the invasive potential of MCF-7 significantly increased. These results clearly show the inverse relationship between Nm23-H1 expression level and invasive potential of breast cancer cells.\n\nTo investigate the relationship between Nm23-H1's enzymatic activity and its ability to influence cell migration, we examined the invasive potential of cell line, MDA-MB-231 transiently transfected with various Nm23-H1 mutants. We employed wild type Nm23-H1 and C109A mutant which resists oxidative stress, called as active mutant. The enzyme activity of cells transfected with wild Nm23-H1 was completely abolished by oxidative stress and sulfhydryl reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). On the other hand, transfection of the cells with mutant, C109A, caused no loss in the enzymatic activity under oxidative stress, but some loss of enzymatic activity was detected by combining oxidative stress and NEM treatment because of the inactivation of active site histidine residue by NEM. This indicates that C109A mutant can be used as an active mutant by oxidative stress. MDA-MB-231 cells transiently transfected with various constructs including pFlag-CMV-2, pFlag-Nm23-H1, and pFlag-Nm23-H1 C109A mutants were examined for their invasive potentials by seeding on matrigel-pre-coated upper chamber (3x10 4  cells/150 microL) and measuring the migrating cells after 24 h. As shown in  XREF_FIG , overexpression of Nm23-H1 wild type and C109A mutant discernibly reduced the migration, and there was further inhibition in cells overexpressing C109A mutant. This indicates that active Nm23-H1 is required for the inhibition of invasive potential of the cells.\n\nTo examine whether cellular oxidation of Nm23-H1 at C109 regulates their invasive potential, MDA-MB-231 cells transiently transfected with various constructs were exposed to oxidative stress and their migration potentials compared. The migration potentials of MDA-MB-231 cells transiently transfected with various constructs including pFlag-CMV-2, pFlag-Nm23-H1, and pFlag-Nm23-H1 C109A and pFlag-Nm23-H1 H118F mutant were measured with and without treatment with 0.5 mM H 2 O 2  for 1 h. Under this oxidative stress, wild Nm23-H1 partially lost enzyme activity, and the H118F mutant, the active site mutant, had no enzymatic activity, but C109A mutant retained its normal activity, as did the positive mutant. As expected, invasiveness of cells expressing wild and C109A mutant Nm23-H1 were similarly decreased, compared to cells expressing control and H118F mutant ( XREF_FIG ). However, inhibition of invasiveness was discernibly decreased in cells overexpressing wild Nm23-H1 under oxidative stress, but the invasive ability of cells expressing C109A mutant which is not easily oxidized by H 2 O 2  treatment, remained inhibited ( XREF_FIG ). This indicates that Nm23-H1 activity is regulated by oxidation of its Cys109, and that it affects the ability of Nm23-H1 as a tumor metastasis suppressor.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nNm23 plays multiple key roles in tumor metastasis, oncogenesis, proliferation, development and differentiation. Song et al. suggested that cellular Nm23 is involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway and that disulfide cross-linking of Nm23 in response to H 2 O 2  might be a mechanism for regulation of these cellular functions  XREF_BIBR . This study a) confirmed that the biological function of Nm23-H1 is regulated by oxido-reduction; b) demonstrated that Cys109 of cellular Nm23, not in its active site, can be oxidized to cysteic acid, to produce disulfide bond with glutathione and inter- and intra-disulfide bonds with C4, C145 and C109; and that oxidized Nm23-H1 lost its enzymatic activity as well as ability to suppress tumor metastasis; and that oxidized Nm23-H1 interacts with thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and is reduced by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. This study is the first to identify the oxidative modifications of Nm23-H1 and propose that cys-109, not in its catalytic center, regulates its biological functions by oxido-reduction mechanisms.\n\nReactive cysteine residues are readily oxidizable, by cellular ROS to various oxidation forms including sulfenic, sulfinic, sulfonic acid, intra- and inter-disulfide and glutathionylation. Recently, other minor oxidative modifications have been identified employing the proteomic technology combined with modification identification strategies and newly developed algorithms  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . We comprehensively examined the modifications of cellular Nm23-H1 using nanoAcquity(TM) UPLC(TM)/ESI-q-TOF tandem MS and found that Cys109 was variously modified to cysteic acid, or to acquire inter- and intra-disulfide bonds or to become glutathionylated ( XREF_FIG ). Cys109 is located in the trimeric interface Kpn loops (residue 99-119) and is involved in contacts between subunits in hexameric structure. Previously, it was shown that interdisulfide Cys109-Cys109 formation affects the enzymatic activity of Nm23-H1 and its oligomeric structure  XREF_BIBR . In this study, we demonstrated that glutathionylation of Cys109 in Nm23-H1 by H 2 O 2  also inactivates enzymatic activity by damaging the binding of the nucleoside in active site ( XREF_FIG ). Reversible S-glutathionylation is an important post-translational modification, protecting protein cysteines from irreversible oxidation and serving to transducer redox signals. Many proteins including p53 are known to be glutathionylated and regulated by redox  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . It is known that human p53 is inhibited by glutathionylation of cysteine present in the proximal DNA-binding domain during oxidative stress  XREF_BIBR . These findings suggest that Cys109 plays a key role in cellular response to oxidative stress via glutathionylation as well as disulfide formation.\n\nWe demonstrated that oxidized Nm23-H1 can specifically interact with thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) ( XREF_FIG ), which known as a selenium containing pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of the redox protein thioredoxin, as well as of other endogenous and exogenous compounds  XREF_BIBR . It is necessary to examine whether Nm23 cellular activity is regulated by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. Thiol reducing systems including Trx, TrxR, and NADPH, reduce oxidized cysteine groups on protein through interaction with the redox-active center of Trx (CGPC, Trx-(SH) 2 ) to form a disulfide bond (Trx-S2), which can be reduced by TrxR and NADPH. Trxs are family of protein having well conserved catalytic site (WCGPCK) through evolution  XREF_BIBR . Trx is a major reducing system that maintains the redox balance of the cell by reducing the various oxidized proteins by ROS. Here we showed that oxidized Nm23-H1 is a substrate of NADPH-TrxR-Trx oxidoreduction system coupled with reduced Trx. ( XREF_FIG ). NDP kinase activity was abolished on treatment with H 2 O 2 , and was recovered by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system in a Trx dose-dependent manner. We then examined whether oxidized Nm23-H1 is reduced by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. We observed oxidized Nm23-H1 on non-reducing gel electrophoresis by incubating various combinations of NADPH-TrxR-Trx-Nm23 components. As shown in  XREF_FIG , reduced Nm23-H1, on treatment with H 2 O 2  can induce the formation of various oxidation products: fast moving intra-molecular cross-linked Nm23 and dimers of intermolecular from cross linking; these oxidized Nm23-H1 can be reduced to monomers by increasing the amount of Trx in NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. Especially, the fast-moving intra-molecular cross-linked Nm23-H1 and one of the dimers can be easily reduced by this reduction system. However, one of the oxidized dimers was not reduced by TrxR-Trx system. This indicates that NADPH-TrxR-Trx system reduces only some specific oxidation forms.\n\nThe relationship between Nm23-H1 expression level and cell migration capability was examined in two breast cancer cell lines, the invasive MDA-MB-231 cell line and the non-invasive MCF-7 cell line. High expression of Nm23-H1 decreased cell migration capability, and reduction of Nm23-H1 by RNAi treatment reversed this effect ( XREF_FIG ). NDP kinase activity of Nm23-H1 appears to be critical for its biological effects. For example, in contrast to wild-type Nm23 which promotes neurite outgrowth, a point mutant of Nm23 (H118A) that lacks NDP kinase activity does not promote neurite outgrowth, but actually suppresses nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Also, the other hand, no correlation of NDP kinase activity and metastasis suppression was reported in previous work  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . In addition, Nm23-H2 can bind to a nuclease hypersensitive element on the human c-myc promoter and transactivate gene expression in vitro and in vivo  XREF_BIBR , and this transactivation is independent of NDP kinase activity  XREF_BIBR , and an enzymatically inactive mutant Nm23-H118F was found to inhibit progesterone-induced maturation  XREF_BIBR . Thus, some functions of Nm23 appear to be independent of its NDPK activity. In this study, we examined the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 expressing various Nm23-H1 mutants, and found that oxidation of Nm23-H1 inhibits the metastasis suppression and that the C109A mutant, not oxidized by ROS, was not affected by oxidative stress. These findings suggest that oxidative modifications of Nm23 regulate the functions of Nm23-H1, NDP kinase activity, and cell migration potential. Regulation of migration potential by Nm23-H1 involves either change in NDP kinase enzymatic activity or in oligomeric structure. A previous report showed that the oligomeric interactions play a major role in the stability of catalytic domain and regulate various cellular functions  XREF_BIBR . Recently, protein interaction changes in oxidized GAPDH were demonstrated  XREF_BIBR , and indicate that oxidation status of proteins are important to regulate the activity and structure.\n\nIn summary, this study shows for the first time that Nm23-H1 is regulated by oxidoreduction of Cys109; that glutathionylation and disulfide formation by ROS inhibit the NDPK activity and metastasis suppressor ability of Nm23-H1. And disulfide formation is easily reduced by NADPH-TrxR-Trx system. Further studies are needed, directed at identifying the elements involved in the regulation of each oxidized form, in order to understand the molecular mechanisms by which Nm23-H1 acts as a suppressor of metastasis. Also we are in progress for further study to examine whether isoform Nm23-H2 function, known as transcriptional activator of c-myc gene, is regulated by oxido-reduction system.\n\n",
