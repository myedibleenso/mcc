      "text":"A ginseng metabolite, compound K, induces autophagy and apoptosis via generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of JNK in human colon cancer cells.\n\n\n\nCompound K (20-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-protopanaxadiol) is an active metabolite of ginsenosides and induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. This study investigated the role of autophagy in compound K-induced cell death of human HCT-116 colon cancer cells. Compound K activated an autophagy pathway characterized by the accumulation of vesicles, the increased positive acridine orange-stained cells, the accumulation of LC3-II, and the elevation of autophagic flux. Whereas blockade of compound K-induced autophagy by 3-methyladenein and bafilomycin A1 significantly increased cell viability. In addition, compound K augmented the time-dependent expression of the autophagy-related proteins Atg5, Atg6, and Atg7. However, knockdown of Atg5, Atg6, and Atg7 markedly inhibited the detrimental impact of compound K on LC3-II accumulation and cell vitality. Compound K-provoked autophagy was also linked to the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS); both of these processes were mitigated by the pre-treatment of cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Moreover, compound K activated the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, whereas downregulation of JNK by its specific inhibitor SP600125 or by small interfering RNA against JNK attenuated autophagy-mediated cell death in response to compound K. Compound K also provoked apoptosis, as evidenced by an increased number of apoptotic bodies and sub-G 1  hypodiploid cells, enhanced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-associated X protein expression. Notably, compound K-stimulated autophagy as well as apoptosis was induced by disrupting the interaction between Atg6 and Bcl-2. Taken together, these results indicate that the induction of autophagy and apoptosis by compound K is mediated through ROS generation and JNK activation in human colon cancer cells.\n\n\n\nAutophagy is a highly conserved cellular degradation process characterized by the presence of abundant intracellular autophagic vacuoles termed autophagosomes. Autophagosomes sequester cellular proteins and organelles and then deliver them to lysosomes for degradation or recycling. 1  Recently, autophagy has been recognized as a cell death mechanism that takes place in various types of cancer cells in response to anticancer therapies. 2 \n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) have an important role in cell death, particularly in cancer cells. A ROS imbalance occurs when ROS such as the superoxide anion, the hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide are produced more rapidly than they are eliminated. Antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed under these conditions, resulting in oxidative stress. 3  Oxidative stress is implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. ROS act as central mediators of cell fate decisions, depending on the extent of oxidative damage. Under physiological conditions, low levels of ROS lead to growth adaptation and survival. 4  In contrast, excessive ROS production causes cellular damage and provokes apoptotic and necrotic cell death. 4 \n\nCancer cells, even at rest, have a higher metabolic rate than normal cells, resulting in comparatively higher intracellular ROS concentrations. Thus, cancer cells are under increased oxidative stress, rendering them more vulnerable to ROS-mediated insults and apoptosis. Recent investigations indicate that ROS also regulate autophagy, a catabolic progression that is involved in energy homeostasis, organelle turnover, development and differentiation, and cancer cell death. 5  ROS similarly trigger autophagy during periods of starvation-provoked stress. 6  Moreover, activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which occurs downstream of ROS, induces autophagy via the upregulation of autophagy-related protein 6 (Atg6, also known as Beclin 1) expression 7  and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) phosphorylation. 8 \n\nIntestinal bacteria in humans and rats form ginsenoside metabolites after oral administration of ginseng extract. 9  Compound K (20-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-protopanaxadiol) is a major ginsenoside metabolite detected in the urine and blood of rats after ginseng administration. Compound K is active in biological systems and inhibits glucose uptake in tumor cells. Compound K also possesses chemopreventive activity against chemical carcinogens, impairs metastasis in vivo, and constrains tumor growth through the inhibition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  We recently reported that compound K exhibits cytotoxicity against tumor cells by the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G 1  phase. These actions occur by a caspase-dependent pathway via mitochondrial disruption and inhibition of telomerase activity. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Furthermore, combination treatment with compound K and radiation enhances human lung cancer cell death 16  and compound K induces apoptosis in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by the generation of ROS and modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. 17  Finally, compound K-mediated generation of ROS leads to apoptosis in HT-29 human colon cancer cells through the modulation of a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. 18 \n\nApoptosis and autophagy are two distinct processes. Apoptosis is a tightly controlled suicide program that serves to remove defective, damaged, or otherwise superfluous cells, whereas autophagy may contribute to either cell survival or cell degradation. 19  Recent investigations revealed that Bcl family proteins regulate autophagy, despite the well-established role of these proteins in apoptosis. 20  In addition, increasing evidence shows an association between ROS generation and the initiation of autophagy. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Several reports have indicated that compound K provokes apoptosis in colon cancer cells. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  However, little is known regarding its ability to induce autophagy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the cytotoxic mechanisms of compound K with respect to autophagy and apoptosis in human HCT-116 colon cancer cells.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nInduction of cell death by compound K in HCT-116 colon cancer cells.\n\nHCT-116 colon cancer cells were treated for 24h with various concentrations of compound K to investigate the cytotoxic activity of compound K against these cells. Cell viability was then assessed using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium] bromide (MTT) assay. Compound K inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ), with 50% growth inhibition at a concentration of 20mug/ml (the IC 50 ). Compound K at its IC 50  inhibited cell growth in a time-dependent manner; however, the growth of normal colon (fetal human colon, FHC) cells was inhibited to a lesser extent than the growth of HCT-116 colon cancer cells ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nCompound K induces autophagy in HCT-116 cells.\n\nNext, we determined whether compound K-induced cell death occurred via autophagy. Autophagy-related cell death is characterized by the accumulation of vesicles. 23  Compound K (20mug/ml) triggered the accumulation of vacuolated HCT-116 cells following treatment for 24h ( XREF_FIG ). The vacuoles were positively stained with the lysosome marker dye, acridine orange ( XREF_FIG ). Autophagy-related cell death is also characterized by the formation of autophagosomes. These structures, as well as autolysosomes, can be discerned by the presence of membrane-bound microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-phospholipid conjugates. 24  Transfection of cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 showed that the fraction of cells with a punctate GFP-LC3 localization was increased following treatment with compound K (20mug/ml;  XREF_FIG ). Compound K also yielded a time-dependent increase in the levels of LC3-II (the processed form of LC3;  XREF_FIG ). It also detected autophagic flux using bafilomycin A1 (BAF), a specific autophagy inhibitor acting as autophagosomal lysosome degradation inhibition, which accumulates the LC3-II. 25  Compound K treatment increased accumulation of LC3-II in BAF-treated cells ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nAn autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) pre-treatment inhibited acridine orange-positive vacuole accumulation induced by compound K ( XREF_FIG ) and attenuated cell death by compound K ( XREF_FIG ). BAF pre-treatment also showed similar results of 3-MA ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggested that compound K-triggered autophagy has a role as cell death process.\n\n\n\nAutophagy-related (Atg) proteins are involved in autophagy induced by compound K.\n\nExpression patterns of Atg proteins provide key information about the autophagic state of a cell. 26  Atg5 and Atg7 are ubiquitin ligase-like proteins that are specifically required for autophagy. 27  The expression levels of Atg5 and Atg7 in HCT-116 cells were both markedly increased by compound K in a time-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ). The expression of Atg6, which initiates autophagosome formation during autophagy, 28  was also increased in compound K-treated cells ( XREF_FIG ). Moreover, siAtg5, 6, or 7 effectively attenuated the compound K-induced LC3-II ( XREF_FIG ), as well as compound K-induced cell death ( XREF_FIG ). These results indicate that Atg proteins are involved in autophagy provoked by compound K.\n\n\n\nCompound K induces autophagy-mediated cell death via ROS generation.\n\nROS can reportedly mediate autophagy-mediated cell death. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Therefore, ROS generation was analyzed in compound K-treated cells by performing 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) staining followed by flow cytometry. Compound K-stimulated ROS generation in HCT-116 cells ( XREF_FIG ), but the enhanced ROS levels were significantly attenuated by treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a powerful antioxidant ( XREF_FIG ). NAC also attenuated compound K-induced autophagy, as shown by a decrease in the number of acridine orange-positive cells ( XREF_FIG ), LC3-II levels ( XREF_FIG ), Atg6 expression ( XREF_FIG ), and the fraction of cells with a punctate GFP-LC3 localization ( XREF_FIG ). Taken together, these results suggest that ROS induced by compound K participate in the induction of autophagy.\n\n\n\nCompound K induces apoptosis in HCT-116 colon cancer cells.\n\nWe next investigated whether compound K can induce apoptosis in HCT-116 cells. Compound K-specific induction of apoptosis was confirmed by the formation of apoptotic bodies ( XREF_FIG ), an increase in the sub-G 1  cell population from 1% of the total cell population to 21% ( XREF_FIG ), and an increase in Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression and active (cleaved) caspase-9 and caspase-3 levels ( XREF_FIG ). Concurrent exposure of cells to the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK partially prevented compound K-provoked apoptotic cell death ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that compound K engenders apoptotic cell death in addition to autophagy.\n\n\n\nActivation of JNK is required for Atg5 and Atg6 upregulation and caspase activation in response to compound K.\n\nThe JNK pathway is critical for the mediation of both autophagy and apoptosis. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Compound K increased the active (phosphorylated) form of JNK1/2 in a time-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ). JNK activation in turn increases the gene expression of Atg5 and Atg6. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Notably, the selective JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly reduced compound K-augmented LC3-II, Atg5, and Atg6 expression ( XREF_FIG ), levels of activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 ( XREF_FIG ), and apoptotic cell death ( XREF_FIG ), as did siJNK ( XREF_FIG ). Furthermore, NAC treatment decreased compound K-induced phosphorylation of JNK, suggesting that intracellular ROS act upstream of JNK to mediate the actions of compound K ( XREF_FIG ). Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of JNK is required for compound K-induced autophagy and apoptosis in colon cancer cells.\n\n\n\nBcl family proteins regulate compound K-induced autophagy.\n\nThe autophagic function of Atg6 can be inhibited by interaction with Bcl family proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) to form Atg6-Bcl-2 and Atg6-Bcl-xL complexes. 20  Here, Bcl-2 functions as an oncogene by negatively regulating Atg6-dependent autophagy, as well as cell death. 30  On the other hand, Bcl-2 phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between Atg6 and Bcl-2, releasing Atg6 to promote autophagy. 8  Moreover, the resultant phosphorylated form of Bcl-2 can also induce apoptosis. 30  Compound K increased the levels of phospho-Bcl-2 in a time-dependent manner, while concomitantly decreasing the levels of total Bcl-2 ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, examination of the interaction between Atg6 and Bcl-2 by immune-precipitation with an anti-Atg6 antibody revealed that compound K significantly decreased the amount of Bcl-2 complexed with Atg6 ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, 3-MA pre-treatment attenuated compound K-induced apoptotic phenomenon such as sub-G 1  cell population ( XREF_FIG ) and caspase 3 activity, which is detected by cleaved PARP level ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nCell death is a complex phenomenon that is independently or coordinately regulated by multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. 31  Programmed cell death is a genetically regulated form of cell death that is essential for various biological events and acts as an ultimate determinant of cancer cell fate. 31  Indeed, therapeutic approaches designed to destroy malignant cells via programmed cell death are critical for the treatment of various forms of cancer. 32 \n\nProgrammed cell death can be divided into two categories, apoptosis and autophagic cell death. Apoptosis was initially described according to its morphological characteristics, including cell shrinkage, dynamic membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. 33  Apoptosis involves many pathways and signaling proteins, such as death receptor family proteins, the nuclear transcription factor p53, and Bcl-2 family proteins. 34  Apoptosis can be triggered through the extrinsic (or death receptor) pathway, which is initiated from outside the cell through pro-apoptotic receptors on the cell surface, or the intrinsic (or mitochondrial) pathway, which is initiated from within the cell. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Autophagic cell death, on the other hand, indicates a cell death that is mediated by autophagy, and therefore suppressed by autophagy inhibitor via chemicals and/or genetic means. 35 \n\nAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that begins with the formation of autophagosomes. Autophagosomes participate in the recycling of cellular components by sequestering damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, targeting them for lysosomal degradation. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR \n\nThe formation of a double-membraned autophagosome requires specific autophagy-associated proteins. Some of the most important evidence for the role of autophagic cell death in tumor suppression comes from studies on Atg6, a Bcl-2-interacting protein XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  that promotes autophagy when not complexed with Bcl-2. Furthermore, constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (also known as protein kinase B)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis, 37  a common characteristic of cancer cells, suppresses autophagy while promoting tumor cell growth, proliferation, and survival. 38  In addition, recent studies have shown that LC3, an autophagy-related, ubiquitin-like modifier, is processed by a unique protein activation/conjugation system to form autophagosomal membranes in cancer cells during autophagy. 39 \n\nIn this study, compound K-induced autophagy in HCT-116 colon cancer cells was evidenced by an increase in the number of autophagic vesicles and the enhanced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Notably, many anticancer drugs (e.g., bortezomib, sorafenib, resveratrol, chloroquine, histone deacetylase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and sulforaphane) similarly engender autophagic cell death. 36  The cellular redox status is among the effector mechanisms implicated in the control and regulation of cell death pathways, including autophagy and apoptosis. Recent investigations have shown that autophagic cell death is associated with alterations in ROS levels and/or the JNK signaling pathway. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Consistent with these findings, we found that ROS generation and JNK activation were both involved in compound K-stimulated autophagy in colon cancer cells.\n\nIn our system, compound K-induced generation of ROS occurred upstream of JNK activation. ROS generation mediates the activation of JNK in the copper compound-induced cell death pathway. 40  Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-dependent ROS production leads to sustained JNK activation and cell death; 41  notably, ROS formation is essential for monitoring autophagy-mediated cell death in cancer cells. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  JNK-mediated upregulation of Atg5 and Atg6 also has a causal role in autophagy-mediated cell death. 7  Similarly, ROS-mediated JNK activation has a causal role in the initiation of autophagy through the upregulation of Atg5 and Atg7, XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  and the subsequent induction of malignant transformation by oncogenic K-Ras. Our results showed that activation of JNK by compound K is required for Atg5 and Atg6 upregulation and caspase activation.\n\nActivated JNK can directly phosphorylate Bcl-2 and indirectly increase the expression of Atg6 through the activation of c-Jun, its target transcription factor. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  In this regard, JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 upregulates free Atg6 levels by releasing Atg6 from the Atg6-Bcl-2 complex, XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  thereby promoting autophagic and apoptotic cell death. Compound K significantly decreased the amount of Bcl-2 complexed with Atg6.\n\nApoptosis and autophagy share common molecular regulators and signaling pathways. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  However, the phenotypic outcome of the interaction between these two processes is extremely complex because apoptosis and autophagy can exhibit either synergistic or antagonistic effects on each other to modulate programmed cell death. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  The mechanisms that generate this phenotypic complexity have not yet been well characterized. Furthermore, autophagy induced by clinically available anticancer agents can protect cancer cells from apoptotic cell death, depending on the cell type and/or the context. 44  Therefore, understanding the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy may be crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of anticancer agents.\n\nIn summary, we showed that (1) compound K induces autophagy as well as apoptosis in HCT-116 colon cancer cells; (2) inhibition of apoptosis or autophagy restores cell viability in compound K-treated cells; and (3) exposure to compound K augments ROS levels and activates JNK signaling. Therefore, our findings provide a basis for future investigations aimed at elucidating the role of apoptosis and autophagy in colon cancer therapy.\n\n",
