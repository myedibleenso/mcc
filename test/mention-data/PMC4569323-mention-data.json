Much of the MAPK Fus3 is monophosphorylated and acts to inhibit signaling in vivo. Computational models reveal how a kinase scaffold and phosphatase act together to dynamically regulate dual-phosphorylated and monophosphorylated MAPKs and the downstream signal.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAll cells must detect, interpret, and respond to a broad array of environmental signals. Most signal transduction pathways depend on the phosphorylation of cellular proteins by protein kinases. Among the best known are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are phosphorylated and activated by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which are in turn phosphorylated and activated by a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). These cascades respond to a variety of stress conditions and secreted hormones and are conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to humans.\n\nThe budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae uses a typical MAPK signaling pathway to initiate the mating response. Haploid cells of the opposite mating type (a- or alpha-cells) secrete peptide pheromones that bind to cell surface receptors. These receptors activate a G protein and a protein kinase cascade comprising Ste11 (MAPKKK), Ste7 (MAPKK), and Fus3 (MAPK). All three of these kinases interact with the scaffold protein Ste5, which recruits the constituent kinases to the activated G protein at the plasma membrane. In addition to Fus3, a second MAPK Kss1 is activated by Ste7 but does not interact directly with Ste5. Thus, whereas Ste5 is required for activation of Fus3 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ), it binds poorly to Kss1 and is not required for Kss1-mediated processes ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Once activated, Fus3 goes on to phosphorylate proteins necessary for new gene transcription, cell division arrest, polarized cell expansion (chemotropic growth and shmoo formation), and cell-cell fusion ( XREF_BIBR ). In the absence of Fus3, Kss1 can mediate the pheromone-dependent gene induction program ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ), whereas other responses, such as chemotropic growth, are abrogated ( XREF_BIBR ). Thus, although Fus3 and Kss1 are activated by the same upstream protein kinases, they have distinct cellular functions. Here our focus is on the function of Fus3 and its scaffold, Ste5.\n\nBased on the specificity of binding, it was long assumed that Ste5 acts to direct signaling toward Fus3 and away from Kss1. Although clearly required for Fus3 activation, Ste5 does not prevent the activation of Kss1 by pheromone ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). It was later proposed that Ste5 is an allosteric regulator of Fus3. In support of that model, a fragment of Ste5 was demonstrated to promote Fus3 autophosphorylation at Tyr-182 ( XREF_BIBR ), one of two sites normally phosphorylated upon full activation of the kinase ( XREF_BIBR ). The monophosphorylated form of Fus3 was partially (20-25%) activated and competent to phosphorylate a variety of substrates in vitro ( XREF_BIBR ).\n\nIf Ste5 were found to activate Fus3 in vivo, even partially, it would raise a host of new questions. What proportion of Fus3 is monophosphorylated in this manner? How does the pool of monophosphorylated kinase affect downstream signaling? Does autophosphorylation on one site facilitate or hinder subsequent phosphorylation at the second site? If autophosphorylation on one site were followed by a dissociation event and transphosphorylation on the second site, the scaffold might act to delay signaling. Alternatively, if the scaffold stabilizes the interaction of Ste7 and Fus3, phosphorylation might occur in a processive manner, without substrate dissociation and reassociation. This would have the effect of minimizing the monophosphorylated species and accelerating full activation of the MAPK ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Thus scaffold proteins could either speed or slow signal transduction, depending on the mechanism used.\n\nApart from altering the kinetics of MAPK activation, a processive or distributive mechanism could influence the dose-response relationship for the pathway. Theoretical and biochemical studies indicate that processive phosphorylation should favor a graded output, one that aligns MAPK activity with the graded input stimulus. Accordingly, scaffold proteins might convert an inherently switch-like MAPK to one that is more graded ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Conversely, distributive phosphorylation is believed to produce an all-or-none (switch-like) output ( XREF_BIBR ). In support of this second model, a number of functional activity assays reveal that Ste5 is necessary for slow and ultrasensitive activation, as is observed for Fus3 but not Kss1 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Thus the distinction between processive and distributive phosphorylation has important implications for signal encoding ( XREF_BIBR ).\n\nConsidering the importance of how MAPKs are turned on and off, relatively little is known about how this occurs in cells. For example, it is still not established whether Ste5, or scaffolds in general, dictate a processive versus distributive phosphorylation mechanism in vivo. To address this question, we employ a new method to quantify the abundance of monophosphorylated and dual-phosphorylated Fus3 in the cell over time and in the presence or absence of Fus3 regulators; these regulators include the scaffold Ste5, as well as the MAPK phosphatases Ptp2, Ptp3, and Msg5. We show that Ste5 and Msg5 in particular act to limit full activation of Fus3 and that nearly half of the Fus3 pool remains nonphosphorylated after pathway stimulation. Of the protein that is phosphorylated, nearly half is in the monophosphorylated state. Whereas phosphorylation appears to be processive, dephosphorylation appears to be distributive. Finally, we show that monophosphorylated Fus3 does not activate, but instead impedes, the pheromone response in vivo. Together these findings indicate that the monophosphorylated species acts in a dynamic and dominant manner to limit signal transduction.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\nThe phosphorylation state of Fus3 determines mating pathway output.\n\nIt has long been recognized that MAP kinases must be phosphorylated on two residues in order to achieve full catalytic activity. This was originally documented for ERK2, for which the protein is phosphorylated on Tyr-185 and subsequently on the neighboring Thr-183 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). This dual phosphorylation alters the conformation of the protein, thereby enabling ATP to bind to the catalytic site ( XREF_BIBR ). These \"activation loop\" residues are conserved in the yeast ERK2 homologue Fus3, and mass spectrometry analysis indicates that the same order of events occurs ( XREF_BIBR ). Our goal here was to determine the relative abundance and potential function of the monophosphorylated MAPK species.\n\nWe began by constructing genomically integrated mutant forms of Fus3 that cannot be phosphorylated at either of the activation loop residues: Tyr-182, Thr-180, or both. We then monitored the transcription of a mating-specific gene reporter. As shown in  XREF_FIG , cells in which the endogenous FUS3 gene had been deleted produced a maximal response to pheromone resembling the response of wild-type cells. In the absence of Fus3, pathway induction is preserved due to the action of a homologous MAPK, Kss1, as reported previously ( XREF_BIBR ). In contrast, cells expressing a variant of Fus3 that can only be monophosphorylated (Fus3 T180A  or Fus3 Y182F ) exhibited a substantially diminished response. This reduction in signal activity is particularly striking, given the near-normal response seen in the complete absence of Fus3 expression.\n\nTo determine whether the Fus3 mutants limit signaling via the primary (Fus3-mediated) pathway, we repeated these experiments but this time in cells that coexpress endogenous wild-type Fus3 and either an additional copy of the MAPK or one of the phosphosite mutants. As shown in  XREF_FIG , signaling was diminished most substantially in cells in which the second copy of Fus3 was mutated (Fus3 T180A  or Fus3 Y182F ). Thus the monophosphorylated Fus3 dampens the mating response and does so in a genetically dominant manner. These findings suggest that the partially phosphorylated form of Fus3 acts to inhibit signaling.\n\n\n\nThe phosphorylation state of Fus3 is dynamically regulated.\n\nHaving shown that monophosphorylated Fus3 inhibits the mating transcription response, we next sought to measure the relative abundance of the monophosphorylated protein in cells. To that end, we used the Phos-tag reagent. Phos-tag is a metal-coordinating small molecule with a high affinity for phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine ( XREF_BIBR ). Addition of Phos-tag to acrylamide gels slows the migration of polypeptides and does so in proportion to the number of phosphorylations on the molecule. As shown in  XREF_FIG , the Phos-tag method revealed three species of Fus3 (corresponding to the dual-phosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and nonphosphorylated forms of the protein) after sti-mulation with 10 muM pheromone, a dose that produces full pathway activation ( XREF_FIG ). As expected, the dual-phosphorylated form of Fus3 was enriched after pheromone treatment, but monophosphorylated Fus3 was still readily detectable. As a control, we established that the individual phosphosite mutants yielded just two bands each, corresponding to the monophosphorylated and nonphosphorylated species ( XREF_FIG ). Whereas the pool of monophosphorylated species was enriched in these mutants, the proportion of nonphosphorylated protein was unaffected ( XREF_FIG ). The Fus3 Y182F  mutant migrated anomalously, equivalent to that of the activated wild-type form of the protein. In each case, only the slower-migrating phosphorylated species was evident using p44/p42 antibodies raised against a phosphorylated MAPK peptide. None of the phosphorylated species was detected in the absence of the upstream MAPK kinase Ste11 ( XREF_FIG ). No bands were detected in a FUS3-deficient strain ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nSte5 is believed to act in part by stimulating the autophosphorylation of Fus3 on Tyr-182 ( XREF_BIBR ). Support for this model comes from in vitro studies using a peptide fragment of Ste5 ( XREF_BIBR ). To determine whether Fus3 is also autophosphorylated in vivo, we compared the mobility of wild-type Fus3 and a catalytically inactive form of the protein (Fus3 K42R ). As shown in  XREF_FIG , Fus3 K54R  is monophosphorylated despite the lack of catalytic activity; as with the wild-type protein, the monophosphorylated species was evident in unstimulated conditions and increased further upon pheromone stimulation. Thus autophosphorylation is not the only means by which Fus3 becomes monophosphorylated and activated, at least in vivo. To determine the contribution of the scaffold Ste5, we monitored Fus3 in the absence of Ste5-Fus3 interaction. Deletion of STE5 blocks signaling altogether, so as an alternative, we used a mutant form of Ste5 in which Fus3 docking is disrupted (''nondocking'' allele, Ste5 ND ). This mutant binds poorly to Fus3 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) and yet produces a transcription-induction response that is actually enhanced ( XREF_BIBR ). Once again we were able to detect monophosphorylated Fus3 and at levels comparable to that of wild-type (STE5 + ) cells. However, the relative abundance of dual-phosphorylated Fus3 was increased (~50%) in the Ste5 ND  strain compared with wild type ( XREF_FIG ). This confirms previous observations that Ste5 does not activate but instead limits the full activation of Fus3 in vivo ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). We infer that Ste5 acts in two opposing ways to regulate Fus3 activity. First, Ste5 binds to Fus3 indirectly via Ste7, thereby promoting activation. This is based on the observation that Fus3 binds poorly to Ste5 ND  but is nevertheless activated by Ste7. Second, Ste5 binds to Fus3 directly and inhibits activation. This is based on the enhanced signaling observed in Ste5 ND  cells.\n\nAlthough Fus3 is phosphorylated by Ste7, Fus3 is also regulated by protein phosphatases. Accordingly, the cellular pool of monophosphorylated Fus3 is likely to be regulated through the combined action of kinases and phosphatases. To test this, we examined Fus3 in a panel of mutants lacking one or more of the known MAPK phosphatases: Ptp2 and Ptp3, which are Tyr-specific phosphatases, and Msg5, which is a dual-specificity (Tyr; Ser or Thr) phosphatase ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). As shown in  XREF_FIG , cells lacking the dual-specificity phosphatase (msg5D) exhibited a decrease in monophosphorylated Fus3. Cells lacking the Tyr-specific phosphatases exhibited an increase in basal levels of dual-phosphorylated Fus3, but there was little or no effect of these mutants in pheromone-stimulated cells ( XREF_FIG ). These data suggest that Fus3 is dephosphorylated by Msg5 to enrich the cellular pool of monophosphorylated Fus3.\n\n\n\nSte5 and Msg5 regulate the kinetics of Fus3 phosphorylation.\n\nTo expand our analysis, we next examined how the relative abundance of the monophosphorylated and dual-phosphorylated forms of Fus3 change over time. As shown in  XREF_FIG , pheromone-activated cells exhibited a substantial (~60%) drop in nonphosphorylated kinase within 5 min, accompanied by a corresponding increase in both the monophosphorylated and dual-phosphorylated forms of the protein. Whereas the pool of dual-phosphorylated Fus3 rose rapidly and showed an initial peak at ~2-3 min, the pool of monophosphorylated Fus3 rose in a more gradual manner. Most strikingly, the relative abundance of monophosphorylated and dual-phosphorylated Fus3 was nearly equivalent after the initial peak of activation (from 5 to 60 min). Taken together, these data establish that a substantial proportion of Fus3 exists in the monophosphorylated state. Together with the data presented earlier ( XREF_FIG ), these findings suggest that stimulated cells produce a combination of Fus3 that is fully phosphorylated (activated), monophosphorylated, and nonphosphorylated (inhibitory).\n\nTo further establish the long-term consequences of differential phosphorylation, we monitored Fus3 in cells lacking the protein phosphatases or that express mutant forms of the scaffold Ste5. As noted earlier, Ste5 ND  cannot dock to Fus3 but nevertheless allows activation of Fus3 by the upstream kinase Ste7. Compared with wild type, the Ste5 ND  mutant cells exhibited higher overall accumulation of dual-phosphorylated Fus3 ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, we tested another variant of the scaffold (Ste5 FB ), one that cannot undergo feedback phosphorylation and binds poorly to Fus3 ( XREF_BIBR ). As with the Ste5 ND  mutant, the Ste5 FB  mutant exhibited higher accumulation of dual-phosphorylated Fus3 ( XREF_FIG ), and this accumulation occurred more rapidly than in either the wild-type or Ste5 ND  strain. Thus binding to Ste5 or feedback phosphorylation of Ste5 limits the activation of Fus3 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). When binding or feedback is blocked, a greater proportion of Fus3 is fully activated. Given our goal of understanding the scaffolding function, we did all subsequent experiments with Ste5 ND .\n\nThere are at least two ways by which Ste5 could impede Fus3 activation. One possibility is that Ste5 slows phosphorylation of Fus3 by the upstream MAPK kinase, Ste7. In support of this model, Ste5 was shown to impart some distinctive time- and dose-dependent behaviors to Fus3. Compared with Kss1, Fus3 is phosphorylated more slowly and in a more ultrasensitive manner ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). In the absence of docking to Ste5, Fus3 behaves like Kss1 ( XREF_BIBR ). Another possibility is that Ste5 accelerates dephosphorylation, perhaps by recruiting one or more MAPK phosphatases. As compared with wild type, cells lacking the dual-specificity phosphatase (msg5Delta) exhibited more rapid accumulation of dual-phosphorylated Fus3, although the differences narrowed after 60 min ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, there was no effect of deleting PTP2 and PTP3. We infer that both Ste5 and Msg5 slow the accumulation of dual-phosphorylated Fus3.\n\n\n\nSte5 and Msg5 cooperate to maintain a pool of monophosphorylated Fus3.\n\nTo further investigate the role of Ste5 in limiting Fus3 activity, we measured the accumulation of monophosphorylated versus dual-phosphorylated Fus3 in wild-type cells, in cells in which the interaction between Fus3 and Ste5 had been disrupted (ste5 ND ), and in cells lacking the phosphatase Msg5 (msg5Delta). For these experiments, we focused on early times and monitored the relative kinetics of Fus3 mono phosphorylation and dual phosphorylation. Compared with wild type, the peak of dual-phosphorylated Fus3 was more pronounced in the ste5 ND  mutant, but the monophosphorylated species remained roughly unchanged ( XREF_FIG , compare top left and right). In the msg5Delta strain, dual-phosphorylated Fus3 was again elevated, and in this case, the monophosphorylated pool of Fus3 was significantly diminished ( XREF_FIG , bottom left). These results are consistent with the view that both Ste5 and Msg5 limit the activity of Fus3. In contrast, a ptp2/3Delta double-deletion strain showed only small changes in the kinetics of monophosphorylated or dual-phosphorylated Fus3 ( XREF_FIG , bottom right).\n\nIn every case, the appearance of the dual-phosphorylated form of Fus3 preceded that of the monophosphorylated form. Although we can envision several mechanisms to account for this behavior, the simplest invokes processive phosphorylation and distributive dephosphorylation. To determine whether a distributive dephosphorylation mechanism can account for our experimental results and to quantify the relative roles of Ste5 and Msg5 in limiting MAPK activity, we developed three mathematical models to describe the kinetics of Fus3 activation and inactivation ( XREF_FIG ). All of our models started with the pheromone-dependent recruitment of Ste5 to the plasma membrane. We did not explicitly model the activation of the kinases Ste11 and Ste7 but instead assumed a single rate-limiting step in the activation (dual phosphorylation) and recruitment of Fus3. Dephosphorylation of Fus3 was assumed to occur in a distributive manner. The abundances of Ste5, Ptp2, and Ptp3 were assumed to remain constant, whereas the production of Fus3 and Msg5 was assumed to increase as a function of Fus3 activity (feedback through gene induction).\n\nAlthough our results and previous studies demonstrate that Ste5 dampens Fus3 activity, they do not establish a mechanism for this effect. Therefore we developed three models to test various scenarios for the mechanism by which feedback phosphorylation of Ste5 by Fus3 limits Fus3 activity. In the first scenario, feedback phosphorylation of Ste5 reduces the rate at which Fus3 is phosphorylated. In the second scenario, feedback phosphorylation of Ste5 increases the rate at which Fus3 is dephosphorylated (perhaps by recruiting a phosphatase). We tested each mechanism alone or in combination (third scenario).\n\nThe model equations (see Materials and Methods) were simulated using the NDSolve function in Wolfram Mathematica 9.0. To perform parameter estimations, we implemented a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm ( XREF_BIBR ) to search parameter space for sets of model parameter values that minimize the \"aggregated\" sum of squared deviations (SSDs) between experimental time courses for nonphosphorylated (npFus3), monophosphorylated (pFus3), and dual-phosphorylated (ppFus3) protein, as measured in wild-type, ste5 ND , msg5Delta, and ptp2/3Delta cells. Surprisingly, models that include increased Fus3 dephosphorylation generated the best fits to the experimental data ( XREF_FIG , top right) and accurately captured the individual contributions of both Ste5 and Msg5 to signal dampening ( XREF_FIG ). Thus the models suggest that the primary mechanism by which Ste5 limits Fus3 activity is by increasing the rate of dephosphorylation, potentially by recruiting a phosphatase.\n\nTo further confirm our assumption that phosphorylation occurs through a processive mechanism and dephosphorylation follows distributive kinetics, we tested a model that allowed for the possibility of a distributive (sequential) mechanism for Fus3 phosphorylation. However, to generate a good fit to the data, this model required that the second phosphorylation event occur substantially faster (by three orders of magnitude) than the first phosphorylation event. Thus this model effectively reduced to a processive (single-step) mechanism, validating our use of a processive phosphorylation model.\n\n\n\nLoss of a phosphatase and MAPK scaffolding confers synthetic supersensitivity to pheromone.\n\nTo test the validity of the models, we used each model to predict Fus3 activity in a strain containing the nondocking Ste5 mutant and also lacking Msg5 (ste5 ND  msg5Delta). Of interest, the models in which Fus3 dephosphorylation is increased by feedback phosphorylation to Ste5 predicted that the double-mutant strain would accumulate substantially more dual-phosphorylated Fus3 than either of the single mutants alone ( XREF_FIG , bottom right). Experimental measurements made in the double mutant showed excellent agreement with these model predictions ( XREF_FIG , bottom right, and  XREF_FIG ). At the level of transcription, the effects of the double mutant were similarly magnified ( XREF_FIG ). Whereas the individual mutants conferred approximately twofold decrease in the EC 50  for pheromone, combining the two mutations resulted in greater than eightfold decrease in EC 50 . This increase in pheromone sensitivity is in marked contrast to the reduction in transcription activation presented in  XREF_FIG , in which accumulation of monophosphorylated Fus3 dampened the transcription response by up to 60%, depending on the genetic background. These opposing effects on activity are qualitatively similar to those exhibited by the \"benchmark\" pathway regulator, the GTPase- activating protein Sst2. Whereas deletion of SST2 confers a decrease in the EC 50 , twofold overexpression of SST2 dampens the maximum response ( XREF_BIBR ). Collectively these data support the predictions of the model and indicate that Ste5 and Msg5 cooperate to limit the accumulation of fully phosphorylated Fus3.\n\nFinally, we considered the role of Ste5 and Msg5 in the mating response. When exposed to high concentrations of mating pheromone, yeast cells will arrest in G1 and expand in a polarized manner. Cells lacking Sst2 arrest at concentrations much lower than that needed by wild-type cells ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) and do not polarize properly ( XREF_BIBR ). In addition, we found that cells bearing the msg5Delta and ste5 ND  mutations exhibited a greater sensitivity to pheromone in the growth arrest plate assay ( XREF_FIG ). To monitor cell polarization, we used a custom-designed microfluidic device and tracked the distribution of Bem1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker of the polar cap ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Whereas wild-type and msg5Delta cells polarized quickly and expanded in a single direction, ste5 ND  and msg5Delta ste5 ND  strains turned frequently and failed to orient in any one direction ( XREF_FIG ). Thus the ste5 ND \nmsg5Delta strain exhibits transcription and polarization defects similar to those reported previously for sst2Delta. Whereas Sst2 limits activation of both Fus3 and Kss1, Ste5 and Msg5 act specifically to limit the accumulation of dual-phosphorylated Fus3.\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nIt is well known that MAPKs are dually phosphorylated and activated in response to an extracellular signal. Here we demonstrate that Fus3 is both monophosphorylated and dually phosphorylated in response to pheromone stimulation. The dual-phosphorylated species accumulates rapidly and precedes the appearance of the monophosphorylated species, suggesting a processive mechanism of phosphorylation and a distributive mechanism of dephosphorylation. The scaffold Ste5 and the phosphatase Msg5 act together to maintain a substantial pool of monophosphorylated Fus3. Monophosphorylated Fus3 appears to be a functionally important protein species, one that inhibits signal transmission and does so in a functionally dominant manner.\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that Ste5 and Ste7 compete for binding with Fus3, and, in such a case, there would have to be a dissociation event between steps of autophosphorylation (Ste5-Fus3) and transphosphorylation (Ste7-Fus3;  XREF_BIBR ). Thus, on the basis of the literature, we expected to observe distributive phosphorylation of Fus3. Moreover, a distributive mechanism had already been demonstrated for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in vitro ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). A more recent analysis, however, revealed that ERK is phosphorylated processively in cells ( XREF_BIBR ). As with Fus3, the monophosphorylated species of ERK does not precede but instead accompanies the appearance of the dual-phosphorylated species ( XREF_BIBR ). These differences suggest that there are additional proteins or processes in the cell that modulate MAPK phosphorylation in vivo. According to one model, the effects of molecular crowding, as exists in the cellular milieu, accelerate MAPK activation so as to appear processive in vivo. In support of that model, investigators showed that the addition of an osmolyte (to displace water and mimic the effects of molecular crowding) conferred a processive rate of activation in vitro ( XREF_BIBR ). Molecular crowding could just as easily be achieved by binding to scaffolds such as Ste5 or Pbs2 in yeast and kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitory protein (JIP) in animals ( XREF_BIBR ). Pbs2 serves as both a scaffold and a MAPKK for the p38 orthologue Hog1, which, like Fus3 is phosphorylated in a processive manner in vivo ( XREF_BIBR ). In this way, scaffolds might act to increase the thermodynamic activity, and thereby promote phosphorylation, of the kinase.\n\nAnother consideration is the effect of protein localization. Whereas activated MAPKs typically translocate into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate transcription regulators, other substrates are located at the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm. For example, Fus3 directly phosphorylates the nuclear transcription factor Ste12 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ), as well as the cytoplasmic protein Sst2 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Moreover, subcellular localization is highly dynamic. Under conditions in which Fus3 translocates from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, Ste5 shuttles from the nucleus to the plasma membrane ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). These movements are likely to affect local concentrations of enzyme, scaffold, and substrate and consequently affect signal output. For instance, when Ste5 is permanently tethered to the plasma membrane, the transcriptional output is more graded than it is in wild-type cells ( XREF_BIBR ). Thus changes in scaffold binding, concentration, and localization can all have potentially important effects on signal output.\n\nGiven the difficulty of reconciling MAPK activities in vivo and in vitro, we took an alternative approach in silico. Specifically, we built a computational model in which Fus3 is phosphorylated processively and dephosphorylation depends on feedback interactions with the scaffold and phosphatases. Our model also posits that feedback phosphorylation of Ste5 slows the rate of downstream signaling and protects against signal saturation. We have shown experimentally that Ste5 cooperates with Msg5 to maintain the pool of monophosphorylated Fus3. Msg5 could be acting directly on Fus3 or indirectly through Ste5 or a Ste5-binding partner ( XREF_BIBR ). Ste5 ND  on its own has little effect on the abundance of monophosphorylated Fus3. When interactions with both Ste5 and Msg5 are disrupted, however, nearly all of the Fus3 protein is dually phosphorylated. Fus3 and Ste5 also regulate the abundance of Msg5 through gene induction, thereby providing another mechanism to fine-tune MAPK activity over time. Independently, these mechanisms dynamically regulate Fus3 phosphorylation. Collectively these mechanisms generate a dynamic self-regulatory network. Whereas Fus3 is partially redundant with the MAPK Kss1, Kss1 does not bind to Ste5 and was not considered in this analysis.\n\nOur findings add support to the proposal that monophosphorylated Fus3 down-regulates pathway activity and does so through phosphorylation of Ste5 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Further, our data provide evidence that autophosphorylation is a minor contributor to the pool of monophosphorylated Fus3. Although our data point to the importance of Msg5 and dephosphorylation in this process, other (as-yet-unidentified) mechanisms may further contribute to the production of monophosphorylated Fus3 in vivo.\n\nCollectively our findings reveal a substantial pool of nonphosphorylated and monophosphorylated Fus3 in pheromone-stimulated cells, and these have an inhibitory effect on signaling. This could account for the ability of a second copy of Fus3 to partially dampen the activity of the mating pathway. Although we do not know the mechanism of inhibition in this case, there is growing evidence that even catalytically inactive kinases can have important cellular functions. Approximately 10% of all human kinase genes lack one of three key residues necessary for activity and are therefore likely to be catalytically inert. Nevertheless, many of these \"pseudokinase\" proteins are expressed and have been demonstrated to perform functions that do not involve substrate phosphorylation ( XREF_BIBR ). For example, a pseudo-MAPK in yeast (Mlp1) was shown to regulate transcription ( XREF_BIBR ) and to bind Msg5 through an unusual docking domain ( XREF_BIBR ). Here we have shown that an incompletely phosphorylated form of Fus3 exists in the absence of catalytic activity and that this monophosphorylated form of the protein acts in opposition to the fully phosphorylated kinase. Given the evolutionary conservation of structurally similar MAPKs, we anticipate finding functionally similar, differentially phosphorylated MAPKs in other systems. A deeper understanding of MAPK regulation should point to new mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies to influence stimulus-response behaviors in humans.\n\n",
