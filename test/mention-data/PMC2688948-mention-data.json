      "text":"Loss of TGF-beta or Wnt5a results in an increase in Wnt/beta-catenin activity and redirects mammary tumour phenotype.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe tumour-suppressive effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are well documented; however, the mechanistic basis of these effects is not fully understood. Previously, we showed that a non-canonical member of the Wingless-related protein family, Wnt5a, is required for TGF-beta-mediated effects on mammary development. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Wnt5a acts as a tumour suppressor. In addition, it has been shown that Wnt5a can antagonise canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in various cell types. Here we test the hypothesis that TGF-beta and Wnt5a can antagonise Wnt/beta-catenin signalling and redirect mammary tumour phenotype. The results provide a new mechanism for the tumour-suppressive effects of TGF-beta.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\nLoss of TGF-beta or Wnt5a signalling resulted in stabilisation of nuclear beta-catenin and expression of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes suggesting that TGF-beta and Wnt5a act to inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in mammary epithelium. Increased expression of Sca-1 was observed in developing DNIIR and Wnt5a-/- mammary glands. DNIIR and Wnt5a-/- tumours demonstrated an expanded population of K6- and K14-expressing cells typically seen in Wnt/beta-catenin-induced tumours.\n\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nThe key findings here are that: TGF-beta and Wnt5a regulate Wnt/beta-catenin activity; and loss of TGF-beta and Wnt5a redirect the phenotype of tumours so that they resemble tumours induced by activation of Wnt/beta-catenin. The findings suggest a new mechanism for the tumour-suppressive effects of TGF-beta.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nTransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis in many epithelial tissues that exhibit a high rate of cell turnover. Consequently, disruption of TGF-beta signalling is attributed to the development of human carcinomas including colon, gastric and breast cancers [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Ligand binding to the type II TGF-beta receptor (TGF-betaRII) recruits and activates the type I TGF-beta receptor (TGF-betaRI) via serine/threonine phosphorylation, thereby activating downstream Smad signal transducers. Although mutations in genes encoding proteins in the TGF-beta signalling pathway are uncommon in human breast cancers, loss or diminished expression of TGF-betaRII confers a 3.4-fold greater risk of developing invasive breast carcinoma in a subset of patients [ XREF_BIBR ] and is associated with higher histological grade in human breast in situ and invasive carcinomas [ XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches, a variety of transgenic mouse models support a tumour-suppressive role for TGF-beta in mammary cancers (reviewed in [ XREF_BIBR ]). For example, overexpression of TGF-beta1 in the mammary epithelium via MMTV-TGF-beta1 or WAP-TGF-beta1 inhibits the formation of TGF-alpha and 7, 12-dimethybenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced tumours. In contrast, interruption of endogenous TGF-beta signalling via overexpression of a dominant-negative TGF-betaRII mutant (DNIIR) or Cre/Lox deletion of Tgfbr2 within the mammary epithelium increases tumour incidence. Recently, we identified a non-canonical member of the Wingless-related protein family, Wnt5a, as a downstream target for TGF-beta in mammary gland development [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nLike the TGF-beta family of polypeptides, Wnt proteins make up a large family of essential signalling molecules that mediate a range of cellular behaviours including cell fate specification, cell polarity and cell migration [ XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, mutations or alterations in the Wnt pathway contribute to a variety of human cancers, the majority of which exhibit deregulated intracellular beta-catenin levels and, thus, increased beta-catenin activity. Evidence suggests the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway preferentially induces mammary cancers from progenitor cells, with tumours exhibiting expansion of undifferentiated keratin (K) 6 and Sca-1-positive populations, along with both luminal and uncharacteristic myoepithelial lineages throughout the tumours. Although most studies have focused on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, other Wnt signalling pathways exist that signal independently of beta-catenin, so-called non-canonical pathways. Interestingly, studies suggest that Wnt5a, a non-canonical signalling Wnt, can antagonise the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway; however, the mechanism and biological consequences of this antagonism vary by tissue type [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ].\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Wnt5a acts as a tumour suppressor. Overexpression of Wnt5a is able to partially revert the transformed phenotype of C57MG cells in vitro after ectopic expression of Wnt1, while anti-sense suppression of Wnt5a expression causes a similar cell morphology exhibited by Wnt1-transformed C57MG cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. Loss of Wnt-5a protein expression in invasive ductal carcinomas also correlates with an increased risk of early relapse and mortality for patients [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Additionally, Wnt5a mRNA levels seem to decline with more advanced stages of breast disease [ XREF_BIBR ]. In light of solid credentials in favour of Wnt5a as a tumour suppressor, other studies present evidence for an oncogenic role for Wnt5a [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. It is likely that the tumour-suppressive and oncogenic effects of Wnt5a are highly dependent on the cell type and context in which the signalling occurs; however, these discrepancies clearly emphasise the need for further investigation.\n\nHere, we show that dominant-negative interference of TGF-beta signalling in tumours results in reduced Wnt5a expression. Next, we showed that expression of DNIIR or loss of Wnt5a in mammary tissue enhances Wnt/beta-catenin activity. In addition, loss of TGF-beta or Wnt5a signalling results in increased Sca1 expression and redirection of tumour phenotype to that consistent with excess Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, including an increase in K6- and K14-positive cell populations. We propose that Wnt5a acts to mediate some of the tumour-suppressive effects of TGF-beta by antagonising the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nInterruption of TGF-beta signalling enhances tumour growth accompanied by diminished Wnt5a protein levels.\n\nPreviously, we showed that expression of Wnt5a is positively regulated by TGF-beta, mimicks the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta during mammary development and is required for TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of branching in vivo and in vitro [ XREF_BIBR ]. To determine the effects of alterations in TGF-beta signalling (DNIIR) on Wnt5a expression during mammary tumour progression we used the previously characterised MMTV-neu [ XREF_BIBR ] and MMTV-PyVmT [ XREF_BIBR ] models of mouse mammary tumourigenesis. Dominant-negative interference of TGF-beta signalling was achieved by crossing MMTV-neu or MMTV-PyVmT mice with the MT-DNIIR model that has been previously described [ XREF_BIBR ]. MMTV-neu;DNIIR tumours were spontaneous tumours generated in the F1 generation of MMTV-neu and DNIIR crosses. In the MMTV-PyVmT study, tumours were generated by transplanting organoids isolated from MMTV-PyVmT or MMTV-PyVmT;DNIIR mammary glands into Scid hosts. Time of tumour detection was denoted by the presence of a palpable 2 x 2 mm mass within the fat pad. For the MMTVneu study, mice were sacrificed when the tumour volume reached 2 cm or if the mice became moribund. The study ended at 14 months and all remaining mice were sacrificed. MMTV-PyVmT tumours arise much more quickly, so all the mice on the MMTV-PyVmT;DNIIR study were sacrificed at 10 weeks (70 days). All tumours generated here were classified as invasive adenocarcinomas.\n\nRepeated measures modelling was used to extrapolate tumour volume at 63 days post-detection for MMTV-neu and MMTV-neu;DNIIR tumours. The results indicated significantly faster growth and larger tumours in the MMTV-neu:DNIIR group compared with the control MMTV-neu                    . Likewise, MMTV-PyVmT:DNIIR tumours were larger at the time of sacrifice (70 days) compared with control MMTV-PyVmT tumours                    . In both models, overexpression of DNIIR increased proliferation rates in the primary tumours, illustrated by Ki67 staining or BrdU incorporation                     . No statistical differences in apoptosis were observed in tumours harboring intact versus altered TGF-beta signalling (data not shown).\n\nWe also identified differences in microvessel density between control and DNIIR groups. In both MMTV-neu and MMTV-PyVmT models, overexpression of DNIIR resulted in an increase in the extent of vasculature throughout the primary tumours, depicted by CD31 immunostaining                     .\n\nBy western blotting, Wnt5a protein levels were reduced in tumours with altered TGF-beta responsiveness in both the MMTV-neu                     and MMTV PyVmT                     models suggesting that, in addition to regulating Wnt5a in normal mammary development, TGF-beta can act to maintain Wnt5a expression during tumour formation.\n\n\n\nAbsence of Wnt5a promotes tumour growth and accumulation of beta-catenin.\n\nTo address the role of Wnt5a in mammary tumour formation, we derived MMTV-PyVmT and MMTV-PyVmT: Wnt5a-/- epithelium by rescue of embryonic mammary anlagen as previously described [ XREF_BIBR ]. After 16 weeks, tumours in each group were classified as invasive adenocarcinomas. Histological evaluation of the tumours by H&E staining revealed the presence of pleomorphic nuclei with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios in MMTV-PyVmT:Wnt5a-/- tumours when compared with control MMTV-PyVmT tumours                    . In the absence of Wnt5a, tumour volume was approximately two-fold greater than control MMTV-PyVmT tumours at the time of sacrifice                    . By Ki67 staining, PyVmT:Wnt5a-/- epithelium exhibited a significant increase in proliferation compared with controls                    . Together, the data demonstrate that alterations in TGF-beta signalling or loss of Wnt5a enhance tumour growth.\n\nSince others have observed high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios and pleomorphic nuclei associated with Wnt1-induced tumours [ XREF_BIBR ] and it has been suggested that Wnt5a can antagonise the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], we tested the hypothesis that Wnt5a is a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the mammary gland. To determine if Wnt5a could antagonise the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in mammary epithelium, primary cells in culture were treated with a recombinant canonical signalling Wnt, rWnt3a, alone or with rWnt3a and rWnt5a in combination. After overnight treatments, rWnt3a increased the levels of nuclear beta-catenin, while rWnt5a was able to suppress rWnt3a-induced nuclear beta-catenin levels                    . The results suggested that primary mammary epithelium is capable of responding to canonical Wnt and that Wnt5a can antagonise this response.\n\nNext, we investigated beta-catenin levels in Wnt5a-/- and wild type (WT) mammary epithelium, three weeks post-transplantation. During adolescence, TOPGAL (Wnt responsive beta-galactosidase activity) activity, a measure of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in the mammary gland, is very low to undetectable [ XREF_BIBR ], so we reasoned that if there were changes in intracellular beta-catenin due to loss of Wnt5a, they should be detectable at this stage. Little to no beta-catenin was detected by confocal microscopy in the cytoplasm or nucleus of sections from WT glands. Interestingly, Wnt5a-/- epithelium exhibited increased levels of intracellular beta-catenin compared with WT                    . Furthermore, subcellular fractionation and protein isolation from WT and Wnt5a-/- epithelium followed by western blot analysis demonstrated an increase in the accumulation of nuclear beta-catenin in the absence of Wnt5a                    . The results suggested that Wnt5a normally acts to inhibit the stabilisation beta-catenin in the developing mammary gland.\n\nTo determine if loss of Wnt5a also affected stabilisation of beta-catenin in MMTV-PyVmT tumours, we analysed MMTV-PyVmT and MMTV-PyVmT:Wnt5a-/- tumours for differences in beta-catenin levels. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy on sections from control and Wnt5a-/- tumours revealed elevated levels of intracellular beta-catenin in the absence of Wnt5a                    . Control MMTV-PyVmT tumours exhibited predominantly membrane-associated beta-catenin. Moreover, subcellular fractionation and western blotting showed an increase in beta-catenin in the nuclear compartment of cells in the Wnt5a-/- tumours                    . Analysis of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes such as c-myc [ XREF_BIBR ], tfc4 [ XREF_BIBR ] and axin 2                     by RT-PCR indicated that the transcriptional activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was enhanced in the absence of Wnt5a. Cyclin D1 was only modestly regulated. Thus, the data suggest that loss of Wnt5a results in increased canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in MMTV-PyVmT tumours.\n\n\n\nAccumulation of intracellular beta-catenin occurs in tumours with dominant-negative interference of TGF-beta signalling.\n\nUpon determining that Wnt5a limits the accumulation of intracellular beta-catenin in normal mammary epithelium and tumours, we speculated that tumours harboring DNIIR would also exhibit stabilised intracellular beta-catenin, probably as a consequence of reduced Wnt5a levels. To confirm this, MMTV-PyVmT tumours with intact or altered TGF-beta signalling were immunostained for beta-catenin. The accumulation of intracellular of beta-catenin was apparent by confocal microscopy in the DNIIR tumours relative to control tumours where the majority of beta-catenin was membrane-associated                    . This pattern was observed in MMTV-Neu;DNIIR tumours as well as in the developing DNIIR mammary gland (data not shown). Moreover, subcellular fractionation of the cells in PyVmT tumours revealed elevated levels of nuclear beta-catenin in DNIIR tumours compared with the control group                    . The results suggest that loss of responsiveness to TGF-beta also results in an increase in Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in mammary tumours.\n\n\n\nDNIIR and Wnt5a-null tissue demonstrate an increase in Sca1, K6 and K14 expression.\n\nWe originally identified Wnt5a as a target of TGF-beta action in a microarray screen comparing WT and DNIIR mammary glands [ XREF_BIBR ]. In addition to alterations in expression of Wnt5a, up-regulation of Sca1 was detected in this original microarray screen (data not shown). Interestingly, MMTV-Wnt1 mice also demonstrate increased Sca1 expression in the mammary gland [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. To confirm the results seen in the microarray, regulation of Sca1 mRNA was compared in WT and DNIIR glands using RT-PCR                    . Sca1 mRNA was clearly up-regulated in the mammary glands of two separate DNIIR mice when compared with controls. To determine if Sca1 protein was also up-regulated, we used western blot analysis                    . The levels of Sca1 protein were increased in DNIIR glands compared with controls.\n\nTo determine if loss of Wnt5a also resulted in an increase in Sca1 expression, we compared Sca1 protein levels in tissue rescued from three separate WT and Wnt5a-/- mice by western blot                    . Loss of Wnt5a also resulted in a significant increase in Sca1 protein levels in the mammary gland relative to WT controls.\n\nWe next tested the hypothesis that the absence of Wnt5a or TGF-beta signalling would redirect the phenotype of MMTV-PyVmT tumours to a phenotype consistent with activated Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. A previous study demonstrated the expansion of a K6 expressing population of cells in tumours that are induced by components of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway, including Wnt1, c-Myc and beta-catenin, yet not in tumours induced by other oncogenes such as neu, PyVmT and Ras [ XREF_BIBR ]. Although this K6 population was not observed in MMTV-PyVmT tumours, we speculated that because MMTV-PyVmT:Wnt5a-/- tumours display higher levels of intracellular beta-catenin and Wnt5a-/- tissue demonstrates increased expression of Sca1, an expansion of this K6-positive population might exist. Using immunohistochemistry we detected the presence of a K6 population of cells in PyVmT tumours in the absence of Wnt5a                    , suggesting an expansion of this population in the tumours. Interestingly, PyVmT tumours expressing DNIIR also displayed an increase in the K6 expressing population                    .\n\nLi and colleagues [ XREF_BIBR ] also established the existence of an expanded myoepithelial lineage in tumours induced by excessive canonical Wnt signalling. The expansion of this myoepithelial lineage was not observed in tumours transformed by oncogenes such as PyVmT. MMTV-PyVmT tumours, in the absence of Wnt5a also contained an expanded myoepithelial lineage, marked by K14                    . The myoepithelial lineage seemed to mimic what was observed in Wnt/beta-catenin-induced tumours, with enlarged and rounded morphology [ XREF_BIBR ]. MMTV-PyVmT:DNIIR tumours also contained this unusual K14 positive population                    . These results suggest that alterations in TGF-beta signalling and deletion of Wnt5a promote the expansion of a myoepithelial lineage typically observed in canonical Wnt-induced tumours. Together the results suggest that loss of TGF-beta or Wnt5a can redirect the phenotype of MMTVPyVmT tumours to a phenotype consistent with activated Wnt/beta-catenin.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn this study, we present evidence to support a model in which TGF-beta and a non-canonical signalling Wnt, Wnt5a, act as antagonists of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the mammary gland. Furthermore, DNIIR and Wnt5a-/- tumours show similarities to tumours induced by activation of Wnt/beta-catenin in their ability to expand a K6 progenitor cell population in addition to a unique K14 expressing population. Specifically, we propose that TGF-beta inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signalling through the regulation of Wnt5a expression and that alteration in TGF-beta signalling via dominant-negative interference or Wnt5a signalling, using Wnt5a-/- mammary tissue, promote the stability of intracellular beta-catenin and redirect the formation of tumours to a Wnt/beta-catenin phenotype.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support a model in which TGF-beta signalling has opposing effects on Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in the mammary gland. Transgenic mice that overexpress a constitutively active form of beta-catenin, DeltaN89beta, under the MMTV promoter/enhancer display precocious lobuloalveolar development and differentiation in the mammary glands of virgin mice [ XREF_BIBR ]. Conversely, overexpression of Axin, a negative regulator of beta-catenin, results in defects in lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy [ XREF_BIBR ]. This is similar to studies demonstrating that interference of TGF-beta signalling during mammary development induces precocious alveolar differentiation in mice, while targeted overexpression of active TGF-beta1 inhibits alveolar development and lactation [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn addition to the mammary gland phenotypes, downstream signalling targets point toward opposing roles for TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Proteins shown to be upregulated by the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, such as c-myc, cyclin-D1 and Id, are usually downregulated by the TGF-beta pathway [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, studies in other model systems provide direct evidence that the TGF-beta pathway can suppress the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. For example, bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), a TGF-beta family member, can inhibit Wnt signalling in osteoblast progenitors via a Smad1/Dvl interaction [ XREF_BIBR ] and, additionally, TGF-beta signalling can dictate the size of the dorsal midbrain by antagonising canonical Wnt signalling and negatively regulating self-renewal of neuroepithelial stem cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. Together with results presented here there is strong evidence for antagonistic interactions between TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways in the mammary gland.\n\nDespite significant evidence in favour of antagonism between TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, other studies suggest that these two pathways act together [ XREF_BIBR ]. The extent of cooperation ranges from similar mutant phenotypes between beta-catenin and Smad2/4 during gastrulation, the necessity of TGF-beta/Smad in mediating beta-catenin responses such as epithelial mesenchymal transition and apoptosis, and also the presence of LEF1 and Smad binding sites in certain promoters. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated a unique TGF-beta/Wnt responsive gene signature in mammary and intestinal cancers [ XREF_BIBR ]. Given the complexity and biphasic nature of TGF-beta in mammary tumourigenesis, it is likely that our hypothesis that TGF-beta acts to inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, and the hypotheses of others that suggest cooperation between TGF-beta and Wnt signalling are not mutually exclusive. Our studies propose that alterations in TGF-beta signalling promote the stabilisation of intracellular beta-catenin, enhancing mammary tumourigenesis, but the effects of TGF-beta on late-stage tumour progression, such as those associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and metastasis, might involve cooperation with Wnt signalling.\n\nThe heterogeneity of breast cancers has sparked interest in the presence of a population of cells termed 'cancer stem cells' or 'tumour-initiating cells' that are small in number, undifferentiated and can give rise to differentiated lineages that form the bulk of the tumour [ XREF_BIBR ]. The specific initiating oncogenic pathway present in genetically engineered mouse models is thought to create distinct pathological features [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Along with the oncogenic stimulus, studies have demonstrated that the cell of origin also can dictate pathological features observed in tumours. Although MMTV-PyVmT is thought to transform a more differentiated cell-type in the mammary gland [ XREF_BIBR ], it has been proposed that activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling supports the expansion of a progenitor population in tumours [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In our model, we demonstrated that in the context of MMTV-PyVmT, a K6 progenitor population and an unusual K14 expressing population were expanded in the absence of Wnt5a or when TGF-beta signalling was interrupted. The results suggest that TGF-beta and Wnt5a redirect tumour phenotype to form tumours similar to those formed by excess Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. By extension, it is reasonable to propose that TGF-beta and Wnt5a may also regulate the stem cell population.\n\nThe existence of self-renewing, multipotent cells in the developing mammary gland has been known for many years [ XREF_BIBR ]. Fragments of mouse mammary epithelium transplanted into a cleared fat pad can regenerate the entire functional gland. Subsequent serial transplantation and regeneration of the initial outgrowths demonstrated the existence of the self-renewing population. Later studies showed that this stem cell population was enriched for Sca1, which was originally identified as a marker of haematopoietic cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. It has been suggested that one of the major roles of canonical Wnts in the skin, intestine and other tissues including the breast is to regulate maintenance and proliferation of stem cells [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. TGF-beta, however, can limit the stem cell population and facilitates the differentiation of this population to a more committed state [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. We propose a model in which TGF-beta acting through Wnt5a limits Wnt/beta-catenin signalling and the stem cell population. Due to controversies regarding stem cell markers, testing this model will require extensive cell profiling and functional studies to re-populate cleared fat pads.\n\nIn summary, the similarities observed in Wnt5a-/- tumours to those tumours derived from components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway provide the first evidence that Wnt5a acts to inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the mammary gland. The fact that Wnt5a is regulated by TGF-beta provides another interesting facet that warrants further investigation with respect how these two factors are linked throughout mammary gland development, in the regulation of stem cell dynamics and during mammary tumourigenesis.\n\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nPreviously, we showed that Wnt5a is a direct target of TGF-beta signalling and is required for many of the effects of TGF-beta in mammary development. The key findings here are that TGF-beta and Wnt5a antagonise Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in mammary tissue and that loss of TGF-beta or Wnt5a signalling can redirect the phenotype of mammary tumours to that resembling tumours induced by excessive Wnt/beta-catenin. These findings provide a new mechanism whereby TGF-beta could act as a tumour suppressor.\n\n\n\nAbbreviations.\n\nBMP-2: bone morphogenic protein-2; BSA: bovine serum albumin; DMBA: 7, 12-dimethybenz(a)anthracene; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium; DNIIR: dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor; EGF: epidermal growth factor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; HBSS: Hanks' balanced salt solution; HEPES: 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; H&E: haematoxylin and eosin; K: keratin; MMTV: mouse mammary tumour virus promoter/enhancer; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PyVmT: polyoma virus middle T antigen; RT-PCR: reverse transcripase polymerase chain reaction; TGF-beta: transforming growth factor-beta; TGF-betaRI: type I TGF-beta receptor; TGF-betaRII: type II TGF-beta receptor; Wnt: Wingless-related protein family; WT: wild type.\n\n\n\nCompeting interests.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n\n\nAuthors' contributions.\n\nKR carried out the PyVmT studies and did the analysis and staining of the tumour tissue.
