      "text":"Deciphering the signaling networks underlying simvastatin-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells: evidence for non-canonical activation of RhoA and Rac1 GTPases.\n\n\n\nAlthough statins are known to inhibit proliferation and induce death in a number of cancer cell types, the mechanisms through which downregulation of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway activates death signaling remain poorly understood. Here we set out to unravel the signaling networks downstream of the MVA pathway that mediate the death-inducing activity of simvastatin. Consistent with previous reports, exogenously added geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate, prevented simvastatin's growth-inhibitory effect, thereby suggesting the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins such as Rho GTPases in the anticancer activity of simvastatin. Indeed, simvastatin treatment led to increased levels of unprenylated Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42). Intriguingly, instead of inhibiting the functions of Rho GTPases as was expected with loss of prenylation, simvastatin caused a paradoxical increase in the GTP-bound forms of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42. Furthermore, simvastatin disrupted the binding of Rho GTPases with the cytosolic inhibitor Rho GDIalpha, which provides a potential mechanism for GTP loading of the cytosolic Rho GTPases. We also show that the unprenylated RhoA- and Rac1-GTP retained at least part of their functional activities, as evidenced by the increase in intracellular superoxide production and JNK activation in response to simvastatin. Notably, blocking superoxide production attenuated JNK activation as well as cell death induced by simvastatin. Finally, we provide evidence for the involvement of the B-cell lymphoma protein 2 family, Bcl-2-interacting mediator (Bim), in a JNK-dependent manner, in the apoptosis-inducing activity of simvastatin. Taken together, our data highlight the critical role of non-canonical regulation of Rho GTPases and involvement of downstream superoxide-mediated activation of JNK pathway in the anticancer activity of simvastatin, which would have potential clinical implications.\n\n\n\nStatins are 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that have been widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents to treat hyperlipidemia in the clinic. In the last decade, mounting experimental evidence has demonstrated that statins exert cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects in a wide variety of cancers, including breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma and skin carcinoma. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Statins inhibit cell proliferation by arresting cancer cells in the G1 or S, and occasionally G2/M, phase by modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  For example, statins were shown to regulate G1/S arrest in colorectal cancer cells by upregulating p21 and p27 expression and downregulating cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity. 7 \n\nIn addition to their effects on cell proliferation, statins have also been reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Although there is experimental evidence to implicate protein geranylgeranylation in the regulation of statin-mediated apoptosis, a complete understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying the death-inducing effect of statins in cancer cells is lacking. Recent advances in this regard provide evidence to implicate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in the anticancer activity of statins. To that end, lovastatin was shown to induce apoptosis in AML cells by downregulating the pro-survival Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. 10  In a separate study, statin-induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells was shown to be mediated by the inhibition of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2) expression, downstream of Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) inhibition. 5  Other reports have also suggested that statins mediate apoptotic response by activating Fas (cluster of differentiation 95-Apo1)-induced apoptotic signaling via their ability to disrupt cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. 11  More importantly, the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of statins are significantly more pronounced in malignant cells compared with non-malignant cells, which has been attributed to the higher expression of HMG-CoA reductase and a greater need for mevalonate (MVA)-derived isoprenoids in cancer cells. 12  Therefore, statins are promising treatment options, with a high therapeutic index and demonstrated specificity in targeting cancer cells. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  However, epidemiological studies and clinical trials assessing the clinical efficacy of statins for treating cancers have drawn controversial conclusions. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of statins is desirable to identify specific targets and signaling networks for potential therapeutic relevance.\n\nHere, we set out to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptotic activity of statins in human colorectal carcinoma cells, particularly focusing on the MVA-regulating activity of statins. Our results provide evidence that simvastatin-induced apoptosis is mediated by GTP loading of unprenylated Rho GTPases, and involves the intermediacy of JNK-mediated Bcl-2-interacting mediator (Bim) activation, downstream of intracellular superoxide production. These data provide a novel underlying mechanism for the anticancer activity of simvastatin, which could have potential implications for the strategic use of statins in the management of cancer.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nSimvastatin activates mitochondrial-mediated death pathway by inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation in HCT116 cells.\n\nIn the present study, we first examined the effects of simvastatin on the viability of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Simvastatin induced potent cell loss in a dose-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ) and impaired the ability of cancer cells to form colonies in a longer-term assay ( XREF_FIG ). We then determined the ability of MVA and two of its downstream metabolites to rescue the statin-induced decrease in cancer cell viability. Simvastatin-induced cytotoxicity and colony-inhibition effects were completely prevented by preincubation with MVA and largely so by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), whereas farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) was much less effective ( XREF_FIG ). Moreover, the protein geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase-I) inhibitor geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI)-298, but not the protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI)-277, induced cell loss ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), supporting a more important role of protein geranylgeranylation than farnesylation in simvastatin's cytotoxic effects. Assessment of proteolytic cleavage of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific protease (caspase)-3 as well as cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) confirmed that simvastatin-induced cell death in HCT116 cells was consistent with apoptotic execution, which could be prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyoxycarbonyl valanyl alanyl-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) as well as preincubation with MVA or GGPP ( XREF_FIG ). Our results also implicate the mitochondrial death amplification pathway in simvastatin-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by mitochondrial translocation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and the cytosolic release of cytochrome c required for efficient apoptosome assembly ( XREF_FIG ). The involvement of Bax was further corroborated by data, demonstrating that HCT116 Bax-deficient cells were relatively resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effect of simvastatin ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These data indicate that simvastatin induces apoptosis via caspase- and Bax-dependent mechanisms.\n\n\n\nIncreased GTP loading of newly synthesized RhoA and Rac1 is responsible for simvastatin-induced cell death.\n\nIn order to identify the downstream targets of protein geranylgeranylation affected by simvastatin treatment in HCT116 cells, we focused on looking at three well-studied geranylgeranlyated proteins: RhoA, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac)1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42). We first assessed the activation status of these Rho proteins after simvastatin treatment. Interestingly, using a GST-protein-binding domain pull-down assay, we show that simvastatin treatment resulted in a significant increase in GTP-loaded RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, and also concomitant increases in the protein levels of RhoA and Cdc42 ( XREF_FIG ). This increment in protein expression and GTP loading was significantly blocked by GGPP preincubation, but less so by FPP ( XREF_FIG ). We then tested the hypothesis that the activation of these Rho-family proteins was involved in the apoptotic effects of simvastatin. Indeed, pharmacological inhibitors of Rac1 (NSC23766 and EHT1864) or expression of the dominant-negative Rac1N17 significantly protected cells from simvastatin-induced apoptosis ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, transfection of siRNAs targeting RhoA or Rac1, but not Cdc42, partially abrogated simvastatin-induced apoptosis ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting the importance of RhoA and Rac1 activation in simvastatin-induced cell death. To further characterize the impact of simvastatin treatment on RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, we assessed the prenylation and localization status of these proteins. To quantify Rho prenylation, we extracted cells in the low cloud-point detergent Triton X-114, 17  which separates cell lysates into an aqueous and detergent phase based on the hydrophobicity of the respective proteins. Previous work has shown that unprenylated rat sarcoma (Ras) and Rho-family proteins partition into the aqueous phase, whereas prenylated proteins partition into the detergent phase. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  We observed an increase of all three Rho proteins in the aqueous phase, which corresponded to the level of unprenylated proteins ( XREF_FIG ). Next, we studied the localization of these Rho proteins after simvastatin treatment, with focus on two cellular locations: the lipid rafts and the cytosol. The lipid rafts are microdomains within the plasma membrane that are enriched with sphingolipids and cholesterol. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Lipid rafts can be isolated by the virtue of their detergent insolubility and characterized by the presence of bona fide raft-associated proteins, such as flotillin after ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient density. 23  Studies have shown that Rho GTPases are found to be associated with the lipid rafts of the plasma membrane. 24  Further analysis revealed that these Rho proteins were decreased from the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM, also referred to as lipids raft) component of the plasma membrane ( XREF_FIG ) and increased in the cytosolic fraction ( XREF_FIG ) upon simvastatin treatment. Together, these data provide evidence to implicate cytosolic, yet activated, RhoA and Rac1 in death signaling induced upon exposure of cancer cells to simvastatin.\n\nTo understand the non-canonical increase of GTP-bound RhoA and Rac1 in the wake of simvastatin treatment, we looked at the interaction of Rho proteins with their cytosolic sequestrant Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI)alpha, as earlier findings have indicated that unprenylated Rho proteins can no longer interact with RhoGDIs. 25  Indeed, we found that simvastatin treatment significantly impaired the association of RhoA and Rac1 with RhoGDIalpha ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting a mechanism for enhanced GTP loading of these GTPases.\n\nAs protein prenylation is a post-translational modification, inhibition of protein synthesis would be expected to prevent simvastatin-dependent apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on simvastatin-treated HCT116 cells. Indeed, cells pretreated with cycloheximide were rendered insensitive to simvastatin, as shown by a significant decrease in simvastatin-induced PARP cleavage ( XREF_FIG ), confirming that simvastatin-mediated apoptosis is dependent on the presence of newly translated proteins. Furthermore, we showed that cycloheximide pretreatment completely prevented simvastatin-induced accumulation of RhoA- and Rac1-GTP, while it alone had little effects on their activation status ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nSimvastatin induces intracellular superoxide production downstream of RhoA and Rac1 activation.\n\nThe critical role of RhoA and Rac1 activation in mediating the antitumor effects of simvastatin prompted us to investigate the downstream effectors of RhoA and Rac1 involved in transmitting the signal. One such candidate effector molecule is the reactive oxygen species superoxide, as both RhoA and Rac1 have been shown to be involved in intracellular superoxide production. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  In HCT116 cells, simvastatin triggered sustained superoxide production as measured by two independent methods, lucigenin chemiluminescence assay ( XREF_FIG ) and the superoxide-sensitive fluorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE;  XREF_FIG ). Preincubation with three different types of cell permeable superoxide scavengers, namely diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), Tempol and Tiron, significantly abrogated simvastatin-induced caspase-3 cleavage and cell loss ( XREF_FIG ), confirming that superoxide is an important signaling molecule in the apoptotic execution. To further understand the link between superoxide production and activation of Rho GTPases, we measured intracellular superoxide levels after preincubation with MVA, GGPP or FPP and in response to inhibition of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 activities. In agreement with the cell viability data, MVA or GGPP preincubation completely blocked simvastatin-induced superoxide production ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, treatment with Rac1 inhibitor and Rac1N17 as well as siRNAs against RhoA or Rac1 also significantly lowered simvastatin-induced superoxide production ( XREF_FIG ). These findings suggest that superoxide production is a downstream effector of RhoA and Rac1 activation, following simvastatin treatment.\n\n\n\nSimvastatin induces JNK activation downstream of Rho GTPases and superoxide production.\n\nSignaling by Rho GTPases or oxidative stress is known to activate the JNK pathway. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Consistent with these observations, we also observed sustained JNK activation as shown by the phosphorylation at Thr183 and Tyr185 following simvastatin treatment ( XREF_FIG ). Additionally, pharmacological inhibitor of JNK kinase, SP600125, significantly blocked the cytotoxic effects of simvastatin ( XREF_FIG ), confirming the essential role of JNK in apoptosis induction. We next asked whether a cross talk existed between JNK activation and Rho GTPases-mediated superoxide production, following simvastatin exposure. Restoring protein geranylgeranylation via MVA or GGPP preincubation largely prevented simvastatin-induced JNK phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ). Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of RhoA or Rac1 activation, as well as preincubation with pharmacological scavengers of superoxide, also significantly abrogated JNK activation ( XREF_FIG ). These findings implicate JNK signaling as a downstream target of RhoA/Rac1 activation and superoxide production in simvastatin-induced apoptosis.\n\n\n\nSimvastatin increases expression of pro-apoptotic Bim-EL in a JNK-dependent manner.\n\nSignaling by the JNK pathway has been linked to altered expression of several Bcl-2 family members in other systems. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Interestingly, we observed a sustained increase in the levels of the extra-long isoform of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bim (Bim-EL) following simvastatin treatment ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting that this pro-apoptotic protein might be involved in simvastatin-induced colorectal cancer cell apoptosis. Indeed, siRNA-mediated silencing of Bim-EL provided significant protection from simvastatin-induced apoptosis ( XREF_FIG ) and reduced simvastatin-mediated caspase-3 and PARP cleavage ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), thus validating the role of Bim-EL as an apoptosis effector in our model system. In addition, pretreatment of HCT116 cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 markedly decreased simvastatin-mediated Bim-EL expression ( XREF_FIG ). Similar effects were observed upon preincubation of cells with MVA, GGPP, inhibition of RhoA or Rac1 activation and scavenging of superoxide ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nTaken together, our data demonstrate that simvastatin elicits potent tumoricidal effects in HCT116 cells by activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. By inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation, simvastatin paradoxically increases the active forms of RhoA and Rac1, which then leads to the activation of the downstream signaling cascade involving superoxide production, JNK activation and Bim-EL upregulation. The model is represented schematically in  XREF_FIG . This phenomenon does not appear to be limited to this particular cell line, as studies using SHEP-1 neuroblastoma cells also implicated the multiple aforementioned players in mediating simvastatin's cytotoxic effects ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Overall, these findings not only provide compelling evidence for simvastatin's anticancer activities, but also suggest the importance of the identified molecular mechanism in other simvastatin-sensitive cancer cell types.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\n\n\nSimvastatin-mediated apoptosis is dependent on protein geranylgeranylation.\n\nIn the present study, we show that simvastatin induces potent cell death in colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 by short-term cell viability assays and long-term colony formation assay. Further investigation revealed that the molecular events in simvastatin-induced cell death are consistent with classical apoptosis marked by proteolytic cleavage and activation of caspases. In addition, the almost complete protection of cells by pretreatment with pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk confirms that simvastatin induces cell death via a caspase-dependent pathway. We also show that mitochondria are implicated in the apoptotic signaling elicited by simvastatin, as evidenced by the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Further comparison between HCT116 wild type and its Bax knockout counterpart shows that Bax-/- cells are much less sensitive to simvastatin treatment, confirming that Bax-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is the major mechanism responsible for simvastatin's apoptotic effects. This observation is consistent with several other reports, showing the importance of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in breast tumor cells, 33  lymphoblasts and myeloma cells 34  upon exposure to statins.\n\nSeveral downstream metabolites in the MVA pathway have been suggested to be involved in establishing statins' antitumor effects, with most of the evidence pointing toward depletion of cellular GGPP. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Our data also suggests that simvastatin induces apoptosis in HCT116 via GGPP depletion. In addition to HCT116 cells, we also observed that preincubation with GGPP rescues simvastatin's cytotoxicity in breast, lung and neuroblastoma cancer cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). One implication from these observations is that the impact from loss of protein geranylgeranylation on cell viability is more severe than loss of farnesylation, highlighting the critical involvement of one or more geranylgeranylated proteins, for example, Rho, Rac and Cdc42, in the growth and survival of transformed cells. In this regard, simvastatin treatment increased the levels of unprenylated RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 as expected, and correspondingly their cytosolic localization. Strikingly, however, simvastatin also promoted GTP loading of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, and also increases in the total protein levels of RhoA and Cdc42. Importantly, these cytosolic GTP-loaded forms of RhoA and Rac1, but not apparently Cdc42, were functional to mediate cell death in simvastatin-treated HCT116 cells, as evidenced by the rescue from this cell death through pharmacological or genetic inhibition of RhoA or Rac1 function.\n\nA mechanistic basis of the non-canonical activation of Rho proteins by simvastatin treatment came from the finding, confirming earlier reports, that inhibition of geranylgeranylation prevented Rho proteins from interacting with its negative regulator, RhoGDI. RhoGDIs are responsible for sequestering geranylgeranylated GDP-bound Rho proteins in a cytosolic complex and for preventing the guanine nucleotide exchange. 39  Hence, we propose that the decreased association between Rho proteins and their cytosolic inhibitor leads to the accumulation of GTP-bound Rho proteins, possibly owing to the spontaneous exchange of GTP for GDP or potentially involving activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. 40  Growing evidence indicates that inhibition of prenylation is able to increase Rho proteins in their GTP-bound form regardless of their localization. The observation has not only been seen in the cancer cell lines used in the present study, but also in multiple cell types treated with statins, 41  and in macrophages in which GGTase-I has been inactivated. 42 \n\nIn addition to the intriguing finding of Rho GTPase activation following simvastatin treatment, we observed elevated protein levels of RhoA and Cdc42 following such treatment that was reversed with GGPP preincubation. Previous studies have proposed that geranylgeranylated Rho proteins are more susceptible to proteasomal degradation; hence, inhibition of geranylgeranylation by statins might slow the degradation process and result in increased protein levels. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  However, we did not observe changes in protein stability of RhoA and Cdc42 in our model. Instead, de novo synthesis of mRNA and protein is more likely to be responsible for the increased protein expression, as pretreatment with transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD) or protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide reduced protein levels of RhoA and Cdc42 induced by simvastatin ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). More interestingly, we provide evidence that simvastatin-induced upregulation of Rho protein level is functionally relevant to the cell death signal, as cells treated with cycloheximide were much less sensitive to simvastatin treatment. Moreover, cycloheximide treatment reduced levels of the GTP-loaded RhoA and Rac1, the two Rho GTPases responsible for simvastatin-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the newly synthesized unprenylated Rho proteins are those that get accumulated in the GTP-bound form.\n\nCollectively, these studies have revealed that post-translational geranylgeranylation can impact Rho GTPases at both translational and post-translational levels, and that the resultant non-canonical activation of Rho GTPases produces species that are functional to meditate the apoptotic effects of simvastatin in cancer cells. Our results challenge the view that inhibiting geranylgeranylation is a means to block the activity of Rho-family proteins. On the contrary, inhibiting the process may stimulate both their expression and specific functions. Future investigations characterizing the status of Rho GTPases in statin-sensitive cancer cells should enhance our understanding of the molecular features required for the non-canonical regulation of Rho GTPases across different cell types.\n\n\n\nHierarchical involvement of superoxide, JNK, and Bim downstream of RhoA and Rac1 in simvastatin-induced cell death.\n\nTo further explore the mechanism of how activation of RhoA and Rac1 mediate the cell death response to simvastatin, we identified superoxide production as an important downstream consequence of simvastatin treatment. Both Rac1 and RhoA are capable of activating the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex that generates superoxide. Indeed, our data suggested that the NOX complex is a main source of superoxide production, as evidenced by the protective effect of the NOX inhibitor, DPI. 45  Our preliminary findings showed that gene silencing of NOX2 significantly reduced superoxide level and protected cells from simvastatin-induced cellular insult ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These data indicate that the unprenylated yet activated RhoA and Rac1 can engage the NOX complex to generate superoxide in simvastatin-treated cells, which then leads to oxidative stress and cancer cell death. One important question that remains to be addressed is the site for the assembly of the functional NOX complex in simvastatin-treated cancer cells, as this is unlikely to be the conventional location of the plasma membrane, as the unprenylated RhoA and Rac1 will not be found there.\n\nThe finding that superoxide generation is important in simvastatin-induced cell death raised the question as to whether JNK signaling was involved, as several studies have linked these two processes. Oxidative stress can modulate JNK activation, XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  and JNK activation has been reported to be required for statin-mediated apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, 48  C6 glioma cells, 49  salivary adenoid cystic cancer cells 50  and ovarian cancer cells. 51  Here, we were able to demonstrate a role for a Rho-superoxide-JNK cascade in simvastatin-mediated apoptosis in HCT116 colorectal cells, indicating that this axis might also be active in other statin-sensitive cancer types. Furthermore, we identified the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim as a downstream target of the JNK pathway. This is consistent with the well-characterized role of JNK-Bim cascade in apoptosis in the nervous system upon NGF withdrawal. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Previous studies have demonstrated that Bim is a unique BH3 protein that is able to directly induce the conformational changes of Bax and Bak, or indirectly activates Bax and Bak by neutralizing the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which precedes apoptosis. 55  We propose that simvastatin-mediated increase in Bim-EL is likely to promote mitochondrial apoptosis by tilting the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Our findings demonstrate the importance of Bim-EL upregulation in statin-mediated cancer cell death, and reinforce the report of Jang et al. 6  implicating Bim-EL upregulation in lovastatin-induced glioblastoma cell death. Together with the signaling cascade we have established in simvastatin-treated HCT116 cells, our data in melanoma M14 cells further supports the notion that the JNK-Bim cascade may be a common mechanism activated by Rac1 signaling to mediate cell death in response to simvastatin treatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nTaken together, our data demonstrates the tremendous potential of simvastatin to induce cancer cell death. Further, the molecular players identified in these studies not only provide novel potential targets for therapeutic manipulation, but also lay the foundation to explore the role of statins as an adjuvant in combination therapies to treat cancer.\n\n",
