      "text":"Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK) 3beta Phosphorylates and Protects Nuclear Myosin 1c from Proteasome-Mediated Degradation to Activate rDNA Transcription in Early G1 Cells.\n\n\n\nNuclear myosin 1c (NM1) mediates RNA polymerase I (pol I) transcription activation and cell cycle progression by facilitating PCAF-mediated H3K9 acetylation, but the molecular mechanism by which NM1 is regulated remains unclear. Here, we report that at early G1 the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3beta phosphorylates and stabilizes NM1, allowing for NM1 association with the chromatin. Genomic analysis by ChIP-Seq showed that this mechanism occurs on the rDNA as active GSK3beta selectively occupies the gene. ChIP assays and transmission electron microscopy in GSK3beta -/-  mouse embryonic fibroblasts indicated that at G1 rRNA synthesis is suppressed due to decreased H3K9 acetylation leading to a chromatin state incompatible with transcription. We found that GSK3beta directly phosphorylates the endogenous NM1 on a single serine residue (Ser-1020) located within the NM1 C-terminus. In G1 this phosphorylation event stabilizes NM1 and prevents NM1 polyubiquitination by the E3 ligase UBR5 and proteasome-mediated degradation. We conclude that GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation of NM1 is required for pol I transcription activation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nrRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (pol I) into a large precursor (pre)-rRNA which is cleaved into 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs for incorporation into ribosomal subunits  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Pol I, in complex with the transcription initiation factor TIF1A, is first recruited to the gene promoter via the upstream binding factor (UBF) and the selectivity factor 1 (SL1)  XREF_BIBR . After promoter assembly, pol I transcription requires the synergy between actin and nuclear myosin 1c (NM1)  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . The interaction between pol I-associated actin with the chromatin-bound NM1 is required for transcription activation  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . NM1 interacts with the chromatin through its C-terminal tail and it is also part of the multiprotein assembly B-WICH that contains the WICH chromatin remodeling complex with the subunits WSTF and the ATPase SNF2h but does not comprise actin  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . While WSTF bookmarks the position of the chromatin remodeling complex on the rDNA transcription unit, NM1 interacts with SNF2h, stabilizes the WICH complex but, crucially, facilitates recruitment of the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) PCAF  XREF_BIBR . An important structural role has therefore been ascribed to NM1 that connects pol I with the chromatin through direct interactions with chromatin and the pol I-associated actin, respectively. This mechanism depends on the myosin ATPase activity. Further, this mechanism activates transcription by providing the permissive chromatin that in turn facilitates polymerase function across the active gene through modulating WICH assembly and PCAF recruitment  XREF_BIBR . At the exit of mitosis, this mechanism is critical for cell cycle progression when pol I transcription must be re-activated  XREF_BIBR . However, how NM1 is regulated at the onset of pol I transcription activation is not known.\n\nGSK3beta is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase regulated by phosphorylation. The unphosphorylated form of GSK3beta is enzymatically active  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . GSK3beta is inactivated through activation of several signaling pathways including Wnt signaling that either leads to serine phosphorylation  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , or disrupts multiprotein complexes that contain GSK3beta and its substrates  XREF_BIBR . GSK3beta regulates cellular metabolism, the cytoskeleton and gene expression  XREF_BIBR . GSK3beta also mediates cell cycle progression by phosphorylating pro-proliferative factors for degradation or by phosphorylating and stabilizing anti-proliferative factors. c-Myc is an example of short-lived proteins that is ubiquitinated in a GSK3beta -dependent manner by the F-box protein Fbw7 and subsequently degraded by the proteasome  XREF_BIBR . GSK3beta also controls expression of cyclin D1, which is phosphorylated to promote nuclear export and subsequent degradation  XREF_BIBR . In contrast, GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation of a single serine residue (Ser-118) in the estrogen receptor alpha leads to the stabilization of the receptor and protects it from proteasome-mediated degradation  XREF_BIBR . This dual mode of activity ensures that cell cycle progression, growth and proliferation are kept under tight regulation.\n\nPrevious work has shown a link between GSK3beta and pol I-specific transcription factors  XREF_BIBR . Induction of granulocytic differentiation in murine myeloid cells results in the degradation of UBF via GSK3beta and the ubiquitin/proteasome system  XREF_BIBR . Furthermore, enzymatically active GSK3beta interacts with the member of the SL1 complex TAF I 110 and suppresses pol I transcription in a H-RAS dependent manner  XREF_BIBR . GSK3beta has therefore been suggested to suppress pol I transcription by repressing assembly of transcription-competent polymerase at rRNA gene promoter in transformed cells.\n\nHere, we studied whether GSK3beta has a more fundamental role in pol I transcription in non-transformed cells. A genome-wide screen showed that GSK3beta is selectively distributed across the entire rDNA transcription unit. Further, GSK3beta is required for rDNA association of numerous factors required for pol I transcription. In GSK3beta -/-  mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) we found decreased levels of occupancy of actin, NM1 and SNF2h, at both promoter and transcribed sequences. These mechanisms, along with ultrastructural analysis of nucleoli in the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs, correlate with decreased pol I transcription through loss of permissive chromatin. Further, in G1-arrested GSK3beta -/-  MEFs, NM1 becomes specifically ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase UBR5 and degraded by the proteasome. These observations collectively suggest that GSK3beta suppresses NM1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitates NM1 association with the rDNA chromatin and promotes pol I transcription activation at G1. We therefore propose a novel and fundamental role for GSK3beta as a key regulator of rRNA synthesis.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nGSK3beta associates with the rDNA chromatin.\n\nWe confirmed the localization of GSK3beta on the rDNA with a novel antibody termed CGR11 against the first nine N-terminal amino acids of the protein ( XREF_FIG ). Since the epitope contains Serine 9, which is kept unphosphorylated in the active form of GSK3beta  XREF_BIBR , the CGR11 antibody is designed to preferentially target active GSK3beta. The CGR11 antibody specifically detected a single protein of 48 kDa on immunoblots of nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (GSK3beta +/+  MEFs), similarly to the commercial pan- GSK3beta antibody 27C10 ( XREF_FIG ), but not in the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs.\n\nWe used the GSK3beta antibodies CGR11 and 27C10 to study GSK3beta occupancy along the rDNA transcription unit by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We prepared crosslinked chromatin from both GSK3beta +/+  MEFs and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs and subjected the chromatin to immunoprecipitations with the CGR11 and 27C10 antibodies. The precipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using primers amplifying fragments of 45S (promoter), 18S, 5.8S, 28S rDNA and the IGSs (intergenic sequences). The qPCR analysis shows that both antibodies precipitated rDNA from the chromatin isolated from GSK3beta +/+  MEFs ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast we did not get any signal when chromatin isolated from GSK3beta -/-  MEFs was used in the immunoprecipitations ( XREF_FIG ). We conclude that GSK3beta specifically associates with the rDNA.\n\nFor further assessment of GSK3beta protein occupancy throughout the rDNA we performed a genome-wide screen by ChIP followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We subjected crosslinked chromatin isolated from GSK3beta +/+  MEFs to immunoprecipitations with the CGR11 antibody and the DNA fragments were sequenced directly. Compared to background genomic binding levels the rDNA repeat showed GSK3beta binding that was approximately two orders of magnitude higher. High levels of binding were found within the rRNA gene sequence, its upstream promoter elements and in the IGS extending 12 kb downstream of the rDNA ( XREF_FIG ;  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In contrast large segments of the IGS appeared devoid of GSK3beta binding ( XREF_FIG ). The pattern of GSK3beta binding across the rDNA transcription unit is similar to the binding patterns of pol I and UBF to the rDNA repeats  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Interestingly, very low levels of GSK3beta binding to other genomic loci were detected ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Although the presence of GSK3beta in the IGSs is not yet understood, the distribution of GSK3beta all along the rDNA transcription unit, including externally transcribed sequences (ETSs), 18S, 5.8S, 28S and internally transcribed sequences (ITSs), suggests that GSK3beta has a primary role in pol I transcription regulation.\n\n\n\nrDNA transcription activation is modulated by GSK3beta.\n\nTo evaluate the possible involvement of GSK3beta in rDNA transcription, we isolated total RNA from wild type and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs and measured relative pre-rRNA levels by quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Using primers amplifying 45S pre-rRNA, in the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs we detected a fivefold drop in the amount of nascent transcript relative to beta-actin mRNA levels ( XREF_FIG ). Twofold decrease in the levels of 45S pre-rRNA levels were also detected in HeLa cells subjected to GSK3beta gene silencing by RNAi ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). To confirm these results in living cells, GSK3beta +/+  MEFs and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs were treated with DRB to selectively block RNA polymerase II transcription and then subjected to in situ run on assays. In these experiments incorporation of the cell permeable fluorine-conjugated UTP analogue FUrD was allowed for 10 minutes and the FUrD incorporated in nascent rRNA transcripts was monitored by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy  XREF_BIBR . Consistent with the qRT-PCR analysis these experiments showed that in the absence of GSK3beta, FUrD incorporation in nascent nucleolar transcripts was down-regulated ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nWe next analyzed how GSK3beta affects pol I transcription. We started by applying methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP), for unbiased detection of methylated DNA  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Genomic DNA obtained from GSK3beta +/+  MEFs and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs was randomly sheared by sonication and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes 5-methylcytidine. qPCR analysis on the immunoprecipitated DNA using primers amplifying rRNA gene promoter show that the methylation levels did not change in the absence of GSK3beta when compared to the reference TSH2B gene, a region of the histone H2B gene which is known to be methylated ( XREF_FIG ). To determine whether the absence of GSK3beta affected rDNA occupancy of the pol I machinery, we performed ChIP on crosslinked chromatin from GSK3beta +/+  MEFs and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs with a human autoimmune serum against active pol I (S57299), an antibody to UBF, and antibodies to actin, WSTF, SNF2h, NM1, GSK3beta (CGR11) and non-specific rabbit IgGs. In GSK3beta -/-  MEFs we detected modest increments in the amounts of promoter and 18S co-precipitated with the pol I and UBF antibodies ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, we detected drops in the amounts of promoter, 18S and IGSs co-precipitated with antibodies to actin, NM1 and SNF2h ( XREF_FIG ). The WSTF antibody precipitated promoter, 18S and IGSs with similar efficiencies from both GSK3beta +/+  MEFs and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs chromatin ( XREF_FIG ). These results indicate that as consequence of GSK3beta knockout the rDNA occupancies of pol I machinery, actin and certain components of the B-WICH complex are altered. These changes were accompanied by decreased PCAF occupancy and H3K9 acetylation levels ( XREF_FIG ). However, the levels of H3K4me3 were not altered. We conclude that in the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs reduced levels of rRNA synthesis are primarily due to a chromatin state which is not compatible with transcription. Morphological analyses of nucleoli in GSK3beta -/-  MEFs were consistent with this hypothesis. GSK3beta -/-  and GSK3beta +/+  MEFs were synchronized in G1 to avoid differences in cell cycle progression, double-stained with antibodies against nucleolin and UBF, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The overall nuclear size and shape were similar in the two cell lines, but the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs showed a significant increase in the number of nucleoli per cell, and the nucleoli were smaller ( XREF_FIG ). The GSK3beta -/-  nucleoli were UBF-positive, in accordance with our ChIP results ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nWe also analyzed the ultrastructure of the nucleoli in GSK3beta -/-  and GSK3beta +/+  MEFs by transmission electron microscopy. In normal GSK3beta +/+  MEFs, the nucleoli were well developed and showed a normal morphology with three typical components: dense fibrillar centers (DFCs), fibrillar component (FC) and granular component (GC). The GSK3beta -/-  cells were instead characterized by reduced nucleoli that often lacked a well-defined compartmentalization and displayed reduced amounts of GC ( XREF_FIG ). We could occasionally observe GSK3beta -/-  MEFs with large nucleoli, but these nucleoli exhibited a highly vacuolated ultrastructure that was never observed in GSK3beta +/+  nucleoli ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Interestingly, the nucleolar alterations that we observed in GSK3beta -/-  MEFs do not resemble the nucleolar disruption phenomenon that has been described in response to a variety of stress conditions  XREF_BIBR . The morphology of the GSK3beta -/-  nucleoli and the fact that they contain UBF, support instead the idea that a larger number of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) becomes activated in GSK3beta -/-  MEFs than in GSK3beta +/+  MEFs. However, these numerous GSK3beta -/-  NORs do not engage in efficient rRNA production and fail to assemble fully structured nucleoli. The morphological analysis of GSK3beta -/-  and GSK3beta +/+  MEFs also revealed differences in the patterns of chromatin condensation between the two cell types. Staining of GSK3beta -/-  MEFs with DAPI revealed the existence of small patches of dense chromatin scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, often in association with the nuclear periphery, whereas GSK3beta +/+  MEFs were characterized by fewer and larger areas of densely packaged chromatin ( XREF_FIG ). This difference was confirmed at the ultrastructural level ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nIn summary, the morphological analyses reveal severe defects in nucleolar function and chromatin organization and together with the molecular analyses presented above support the conclusion that GSK3beta contributes to pol I transcription activation by indirectly inducing a permissive chromatin state.\n\n\n\nGSK3beta phosphorylates and stabilizes NM1 at early G1.\n\nActin, NM1, SNF2h and PCAF levels along the rDNA transcription unit are dependent on GSK3beta ( XREF_FIG ). To test whether GSK3beta interacts with actin, NM1, SNF2h, WSTF or PCAF, we applied immunoprecipitations to nuclear lysates from GSK3beta +/+  MEFs. Briefly, we incubated nuclear lysates with the anti- GSK3beta antibody CGR11. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated fractions by immunoblotting showed that endogenous GSK3beta co-precipitated NM1 as well as actin whereas SNF2h, PCAF, and WSTF were not co-immunoprecipitated ( XREF_FIG ). These results show that in the nucleus GSK3beta is part of the same complex with NM1 and actin.\n\nTo evaluate whether GSK3beta targets any specific regions of NM1, we used HEK293T cell lines stably expressing V5-tagged wild-type NM1 (V5-wtNM1), a V5-tagged NM1 mutant with impaired actin binding function (V5-RK605AA NM1) as well as V5-tagged deletion constructs that lack IQ motifs (V5-DeltaIQ NM1) or the tail domain (V5-DeltaC NM1)  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  ( XREF_FIG ). We subjected total lysates from each of the above cell lines to immunoprecipitations with an anti-V5 antibody to pull down the NM1 constructs. Analysis of the co-immunoprecipitated proteins on immunoblots with the CGR11 antibody showed specific co-precipitations of endogenous GSK3beta with V5-wtNM1 but not with the V5-RK605AA NM1 ( XREF_FIG ). Further, GSK3beta co-precipitated with V5-DeltaIQ NM1 and with lower efficiency, also with V5-DeltaC NM1 ( XREF_FIG ). Interestingly, a recent study supports the possibility of a direct interaction with NM1 as three putative GSK consensus sites were identified in the C-terminus of the human NM1  XREF_BIBR . Our present results suggest that NM1 and GSK3beta are part of the same complex and further indicate that the association is negatively affected when NM1 cannot interact with actin.\n\nTo start evaluating whether GSK3beta phosphorylates NM1, we resolved extracts from growing GSK3beta +/+  MEFs or GSK3beta -/-  MEFs by phosphate affinity SDS PAGE  XREF_BIBR . In these assays, extensive protein phosphorylation is revealed by comparing changes in the protein electrophoretic mobility on immunoblots of lysates treated or untreated with alkaline phosphatase. The results of immunoblots of growing GSK3beta +/+  MEFs lysates for NM1 showed specific gel retardations which were lost upon phosphatase treatment ( XREF_FIG , lanes 1, 2). Similar results were obtained upon analysis of GSK3beta -/-  MEFs lysates ( XREF_FIG , lanes 5, 6), altogether suggesting that in growing cells NM1 is extensively phosphorylated but not by GSK3beta. We next applied phosphate affinity SDS PAGE to resolve lysates from GSK3beta +/+  MEFs or GSK3beta -/-  MEFs blocked in G1 by serum starvation (see also  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Even though we did not reveal the same extent of gel retardation as in growing cells, upon alkaline phosphatase treatment on wild type lysates we observed considerable reduction in the amount of NM1 ( XREF_FIG , lanes 3,4). Remarkably, analysis of immunoblots of lysates from the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs blocked in G1 showed decreased NM1 levels independent of the alkaline phosphatase treatment ( XREF_FIG , lanes 7, 8). In support of this observation, analysis on immunoblots of lysates from GSK3beta -/-  MEFs blocked in G1 by contact inhibition  XREF_BIBR  independently revealed a similar drop in the NM1 protein levels (see also  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY -B). Immunoblots performed on the phosphate affinity SDS PAGE for actin revealed that endogenous actin is phosphorylated, but phosphorylation appears to be independent of GSK3beta since it was not affected in either growing or G1-blocked GSK3beta -/-  MEFs ( XREF_FIG ). Furthermore, in contrast to NM1, the expression levels of endogenous actin were not affected in growing or G1-arrested GSK3beta -/-  MEFs. We therefore conclude that at G1 NM1 is specifically stabilized by GSK3beta and this regulation possibly occurs through a direct interaction.\n\nWe next investigated whether GSK3beta directly phosphorylates NM1. To start addressing this point, we prepared G1 lysates from GSK3beta -/-  MEFs, untreated or treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, under which conditions the NM1 levels are rescued (see also  XREF_FIG ). Lysates were supplemented with gamma- 33 P-ATP and with purified recombinant GSK3beta. Following incubation, endogenous NM1 was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging ( XREF_FIG ). The results show that a fraction of the immunoprecipitated NM1 was phosphorylated by recombinant GSK3beta in the presence of MG132 ( XREF_FIG ). To confirm that endogenous NM1 is a substrate for GSK3beta, we subjected lysates from G1-arrested GSK3beta  -/-  MEFs treated with MG132 to immunoprecipitations with anti-NM1 or anti-actin antibodies. After the immunoprecipitations, the beads were washed and the bound NM1 or actin were incubated with gamma- 33 P-ATP and with purified recombinant GSK3beta. Following incubation, the endogenous NM1 and actin were eluted from the beads and resolved by SDS PAGE. Analysis by phosphorimaging shows that a radioactive band was detected only for NM1 but not for actin ( XREF_FIG ), indicating that NM1 is a direct substrate for GSK3beta. Consistent with previous observations  XREF_BIBR , in the same assay, a degree of GSK3beta autophosphorylation was also detected. To further endorse the specificity of these results and identify potential phosphorylation sites in the NM1 primary sequence, we immunoprecipitated endogenous NM1 from nuclear extracts of MG132-treated GSK3beta +/+  MEFs and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs arrested in G1. The immunoprecipitated protein fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to in gel digestion. The resulting peptides were extracted and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated NM1 from the G1 GSK3beta +/+  MEFs nuclear lysate identified the peptide DGIIDFTSGSELLITK in both its phosphorylated ( XREF_FIG ) and non-phosphorylated state ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) with mascot ion scores of 61 and 94, respectively. The MS/MS data indicates that within the above peptide the phosphorylation is present at Serine 8 which in the mouse full length NM1 amino acid sequence corresponds to the Serine 1020 located in the NM1 C-terminal tail (Accession number, Q9WTI7-3). In contrast, the same analysis performed on the endogenous NM1 immunoprecipitated from the G1 GSK3beta -/-  MEFs nuclear lysate identified the non-phosphorylated peptide DGIIDFTSGSELLITK with a mascot ion score of 78 ( XREF_FIG ) but did not reveal its phosphorylated form. These results show that Ser-1020 is directly phosphorylated by GSK3beta in early G1.\n\nWe conclude that the endogenous NM1 is a bona fide phosphorylation substrate for GSK3beta. Phosphorylation specifically targets the NM1 C-terminus at Ser-1020 and occurs in G1. We suggest that at the exit of mitosis GSK3beta phosphorylation stabilizes NM1 from proteasome-mediated degradation.\n\n\n\nGSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation facilitates NM1 association with rDNA at G1.\n\nCell cycle profiling by flow cytometry and NM1 steady state expression analysis in GSK3beta +/+  MEFs and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs after release from a G1 block confirmed a specific down regulation of NM1 ( XREF_FIG ;  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In the absence of GSK3beta NM1 down-regulation is at the protein level since qRT-PCR analysis of the relative NM1 mRNA levels in the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs were not altered in comparison to those in the GSK3beta +/+  MEFs ( XREF_FIG ). Furthermore, we isolated total RNA from wild type and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs blocked in early G1 and measured relative 45S pre-rRNA levels by qRT-PCR. Using both serum starvation and contact inhibition to arrest cells in G1, we detected significant drops in the amount of nascent transcript relative to beta-tubulin mRNA levels ( XREF_FIG ; Figure 5SC).\n\nWe next synchronized GSK3beta -/-  MEFs in G1 by serum starvation and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. After release from the G1 block, total lysates were collected at 0 h, 4 h and 8 h and analyzed for NM1 protein levels on immunoblots. In lysates from untreated GSK3beta -/-  MEFs, NM1 expression was down at 0 h and 4 h after release from the G1 block and was rescued around 8 h after the release ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, immunoblots of lysates from MG132-treated GSK3beta -/-  MEFs showed a marginal increase in the NM1 protein levels between 0 h and 8 h after the G1 block release ( XREF_FIG ), altogether suggesting selective degradation of NM1 by the proteasome at early G1. Since treatment with MG132 rescued the levels of NM1, we further evaluated whether by inhibiting the proteasome we could also rescue the ability of NM1 to bind to the rDNA chromatin. We therefore performed ChIP on crosslinked chromatin from GSK3beta +/+  and GSK3beta -/-  MEFs blocked in G1, treated or untreated with MG132, using antibodies to NM1 and GSK3beta (CGR11). The precipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR with primers specific for the rDNA promoter. In the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs the NM1 antibodies precipitated the promoter 2-fold less efficiently ( XREF_FIG ), possibly due to NM1 degradation by the proteasome. NM1 occupancy on the promoter was not restored even in the presence of MG132 ( XREF_FIG ). On the contrary, in ChIP experiments performed on chromatin from GSK3beta +/+  MEFs at G1 the anti-NM1 antibody co-precipitated the promoter, independently of the MG132 treatment ( XREF_FIG ). These results show that at G1, rescuing the NM1 protein levels by proteasome inhibition does not restore the ability of NM1 to efficiently bind the chromatin in the absence of GSK3beta. To find out whether GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation of NM1 modulates association with the rDNA, we treated GSK3beta +/+  MEFs arrested at G1 with the cell-permeable GSK3beta inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (BIO)  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . On immunoblots of lysates of BIO-treated GSK3beta +/+  MEFs the reactivity of CGR11 to GSK3beta was considerably decreased whereas the pan-GSK3beta antibody 27C10 and the antibodies to actin and NM1 were not affected by the BIO treatment ( XREF_FIG ). Using the CGR11 antibody we performed ChIP on crosslinked chromatin from BIO-treated GSK3beta +/+  MEFs to monitor occupancies of NM1 and active GSK3beta at the rDNA promoter. The qPCR results show that upon inhibition of the GSK3beta kinase activity with BIO, GSK3beta does not co-precipitate rDNA and under the same conditions, NM1 shows a 50% drop in rDNA binding ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nWe conclude that at G1 GSK3beta phosphorylates NM1 to facilitate NM1 association with the rDNA chromatin while simultaneously protecting NM1 from degradation by the proteasome.\n\n\n\nAt G1 GSK3beta phosphorylates NM1 to suppress ubiquitination by the E3 ligase UBR5.\n\nWe next determined whether NM1 is a GSK3beta-dependent substrate for ubiquitination. For this purpose cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encompassing a HA-tagged version of the ubiquitin open reading frame. Following expression of the HA-ubiquitin, cells were arrested in G1 by serum starvation and treated with MG132. We prepared total lysates and subjected them to immunoprecipitations with the anti-NM1 antibody. The fractions of co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on immunoblots for HA-tagged ubiquitin. The results show that in contrast to GSK3beta +/+  MEFs, in G1 lysates from GSK3beta -/-  MEFs treated with MG132, NM1 becomes polyubiquitinated ( XREF_FIG ). NM1 polyubiquitination was not detected in lysates from growing GSK3beta -/-  MEFs even in the presence of MG132 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), whereas in lysates prepared from growing GSK3beta +/+  MEFs or HEK293T cells NM1 appears to be polyubiquitinated ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY -C). To confirm these results in an independent cellular system, HeLa cells were incubated with a master mix containing the HA-tagged ubiquitin plasmid and siRNA oligonucleotides for specific GSK3beta gene silencing (GSK3beta RNAi) or control scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (scrRNAi) ( XREF_FIG ;  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). HeLa cells were maintained at G1 by serum starvation and were treated with MG132. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations with anti-NM1 antibodies and the co-immunoprecipitated protein fractions were analyzed on immunoblots for HA-tagged ubiquitin. The results show a marked increase in the levels of endogenous NM1 polyubiquitination in lysates of GSK3beta-silenced HeLa cells treated with MG132 ( XREF_FIG , lanes 3 and 6). We conclude that NM1 polyubiquitination is dependent on GSK3beta only at G1.\n\nTo identify possible E3 ligases involved in NM1 ubiquitination, we subjected nuclear lysates from untreated or MG132-treated GSK3beta +/+  MEFs to immunoprecipitations with antibodies to NM1. The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis by nLC-MS/MS. Within the subset of co-immunoprecipitated proteins we found two candidate E3 ligases, UBR5 and F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 8 (Fbxw8) ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Remarkably, UBR5 and Fbxw8 were not co-precipitated with NM1 from MG132-treated GSK3beta +/+  MEFs nuclear lysates ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), suggesting a functional association with NM1. To find out whether UBR5 and Fbxw8 target NM1 for ubiquitination in a GSK3beta-dependent manner at G1, we silenced the UBR5 and Fbxw8 genes in the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin and maintained at G1. After treatment with MG132, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations with anti-NM1 antibodies and the co-immunoprecipitated protein fractions were analyzed on immunoblots for HA-tagged ubiquitin. The results show that silencing Fbxw8 did not affect the level of NM1 polyubiquitination compared to control scrRNAi ( XREF_FIG ). On the contrary NM1 polyubiquitination was not observed upon UBR5 gene silencing ( XREF_FIG ). We conclude that in the absence of GSK3beta NM1 polyubiquitination is specifically mediated by UBR5 at G1.\n\nIn summary, NM1 phosphorylation by GSK3beta blocks NM1 ubiquitination by UBR5 and degradation by the proteasome, leads to NM1 association with the chromatin and promotes rDNA transcription activation at G1.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nBy interacting with some components of the SL1 complex, in cells transformed with oncogenic H-RAS GSK3beta functions as negative regulator of rDNA transcription suppressing assembly of transcription-competent pol I at the gene promoter  XREF_BIBR . Here we show for the first time that GSK3beta also has a positive role on the basal mechanism that leads to activation of rRNA synthesis. Genomic analysis of GSK3beta by ChIP-Seq showed that GSK3beta selectively distributes across the entire rDNA transcription unit and to a certain degree, GSK3beta also binds to intergenic sequences. This association with the gene is shown to be functional since in the GSK3beta knockout MEFs we found a fivefold reduction in rRNA synthesis levels, which correlated with increased levels of pol I occupancy at the rRNA gene promoter. Furthermore, results from the ChIP analysis showed decreased occupancy for actin, NM1 and SNF2h at the promoter and across the gene. We have recently shown that NM1 binds the rDNA chromatin, to promote the activation of pol I transcription by stabilizing the B-WICH complex, such that it can subsequently recruit the HAT PCAF. These mechanisms contribute to the permissive chromatin required for pol I transcription activation  XREF_BIBR . These results are compatible with the pol I transcriptional drop observed in the GSK3beta knockout MEFs where the rRNA gene promoter is almost quantitatively devoid of the HAT PCAF and displays a fourfold down-regulation in the levels of H3K9 acetylation. Local impairment of H3 acetylation is accompanied by moderate impairment of the chromatin remodeling function due to the absence of SNF2h at the gene promoter. The morphological analysis of GSK3beta -/-  MEFs suggests that in the absence of GSK3beta activity the cell activates additional NORs, probably in an attempt to compensate for the reduced rRNA production. The GSK3beta -/-  nucleoli are not fully functional but do recruit nucleolin and UBF, which indicates that these nucleoli are functional to some extent, in agreement with our molecular analysis. The GSK3beta -/-  MEFs also display differences in the overall patterns of chromatin condensation. These chromatin changes could either be a direct consequence of impaired GSK3beta function or an indirect response to the reduced ribosome biosynthetic capacity of the cell. In any case, the severe structural alterations observed in the nuclei of GSK3beta -/-  cells support the important role of GSK3beta in rRNA biogenesis. We conclude that GSK3beta contributes to transcription activation and maintenance by regulating local rDNA chromatin modifications.\n\nOur results suggest that across the rDNA transcription unit GSK3beta performs its regulatory function by targeting pol I-associated factors. GSK3beta is a promiscuous enzyme  XREF_BIBR  that phosphorylates serine or threonine at position 4 of the consensus sites S/TXXXS/T[PO3]  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , but also single Ser residues outside the above mentioned consensus sequence  XREF_BIBR . About 20% of the mammalian proteome contains multiple putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites  XREF_BIBR . UBF has, for instance, five putative GSK consensus sites and it is directly phosphorylated by GSK3beta in vitro and in vivo  XREF_BIBR . Both NM1 and actin were also found to be potential GSK3beta substrates  XREF_BIBR . Accordingly, we found that GSK3beta co-precipitated NM1 and actin from nuclear lysates, but not SNF2h, WSTF or PCAF. This suggests that GSK3beta is part of the same complex with actin and NM1. We found however that only NM1 is directly phosphorylated by GSK3beta and that NM1 phosphorylation by GSK3beta occurs on a single Serine residue (Ser-1020), located within the murine NM1 C-terminal tail domain. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a single NM1 phosphopeptide in G1-arrested GSK3beta +/+  MEFs but not in the GSK3beta -/-  MEFs. We cannot exclude the presence of other GSK3beta phosphorylation sites; Ser-1020 phosphorylation however, seems to occur outside the canonical GSK3beta consensus site. Considering that the state of NM1 phosphorylation is not dependent on GSK3beta in growing cells, we conclude that the Ser-1020 phosphorylation by GSK3beta exclusively occurs in G1.\n\nGSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation can lead to either stabilization of the substrates or further polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . UBF phosphorylation by GSK3beta promotes UBF degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, concomitantly with differentiation of myeloid cells  XREF_BIBR . Our results therefore indicate that at early G1, GSK3beta phosphorylates NM1 to prevent NM1 polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Consistently, in the absence of GSK3beta, we discovered that at G1 NM1 is polyubiquitinated by UBR5 and rapidly degraded. UBR5, also termed EDD/hHyd, is an E3 ligase that targets the N-terminus of its substrates and interacts with GSK3beta  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . UBR5 resides in the nucleolus and it is known to associate with SIRT7  XREF_BIBR . Furthermore, UBR5 seems to have a huge impact on cell cycle progression. UBR5 regulates S-phase and G2/M DNA damage checkpoints, it induces cell cycle arrest by increasing p53 levels and has been recently implicated in cellular proliferation  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Since in G1-arrested GSK3beta -/-  MEFs we discovered an almost quantitative drop in the levels of nascent rRNA, we now hypothesize that GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation protects NM1 from UBR5-mediated polyubiquitination, and this mechanism is important for pol I transcription activation and progression through the cell cycle ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nA key question is why NM1 phosphorylation by GSK3beta is important for rRNA synthesis at a specific temporal window of the cell cycle. We recently demonstrated that NM1 binds the rDNA chromatin through its C-terminal tail, interacts with the pol I-associated actin and this interaction is dependent on the myosin ATPase cycle. Association with the chromatin stabilizes actin-binding and allows for the establishment of permissive chromatin required for pol I transcription activation and cell cycle progression  XREF_BIBR . In the GSK3beta knockout cells arrested in G1, the rRNA gene promoter displays reduced NM1 levels even when the NM1 protein expression is rescued by MG132 treatment. Similarly, NM1 promoter occupancy levels drop after inhibition of GSK3beta activity in living cells by treatment with BIO. The NM1 C-terminal tail is necessary for chromatin association  XREF_BIBR . It is therefore possible that phosphorylation by GSK3beta is a primary requirement for NM1 to bind the rRNA gene promoter. Since NM1 association with the rDNA is a condition for actin occupancy  XREF_BIBR , it is tempting to speculate that by enhancing association of NM1 with the chromatin, phosphorylation at Ser-1020 indirectly stabilizes the actomyosin complex on the rDNA; this may be achieved by tethering of GSK3beta to NM1 through actin.\n\nHow the NM1 phosphorylation by GSK3beta is restricted to the G1 phase of the cell cycle is not known and deserves further investigation. Our working model is however that at G1 GSK3beta-mediated NM1 phosphorylation unleashes a domino effect that maintains the actin-NM1 complex and B-WICH assembly on the rDNA chromatin. This mechanism therefore stabilizes the multiprotein complex that contains GSK3beta and its substrate NM1 and contributes to defining the structure and organization of the pol I machinery with respect to its chromatin template for pol I transcription activation and cell cycle progression.\n\nIn summary we propose a novel gatekeeping function for GSK3beta across the rDNA, where GSK3beta targets NM1 and consequently controls local chromatin modifications compatible with rRNA synthesis by instructing G1 cells to slow down NM1 degradation. In the GSK3beta knockouts, cell cycle progression and in particular, the transition to S-phase occurs more rapidly than in wild type cells. The dual mode of GSK3beta activity ensures that cell cycle progression is kept under tight regulation in proliferating cells  XREF_BIBR . It is therefore tempting to speculate that NM1 is a novel proliferative factor that is directly stabilized by GSK3beta at G1 and it is likely to be altered concomitantly with inactivation of GSK3beta, possibly in response to intracellular signaling.\n\n",
