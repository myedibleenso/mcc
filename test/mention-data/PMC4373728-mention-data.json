      "text":"Tumor Cells Switch to Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation under Radiation via mTOR-Mediated Hexokinase II Inhibition - A Warburg-Reversing Effect.\n\n\n\nA unique feature of cancer cells is to convert glucose into lactate to produce cellular energy, even under the presence of oxygen. Called aerobic glycolysis [The Warburg Effect] it has been extensively studied and the concept of aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells is generally accepted. However, it is not clear if aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells is fixed, or can be reversed, especially under therapeutic stress conditions. Here, we report that mTOR, a critical regulator in cell proliferation, can be relocated to mitochondria, and as a result, enhances oxidative phosphorylation and reduces glycolysis. Three tumor cell lines (breast cancer MCF-7, colon cancer HCT116 and glioblastoma U87) showed a quick relocation of mTOR to mitochondria after irradiation with a single dose 5 Gy, which was companied with decreased lactate production, increased mitochondrial ATP generation and oxygen consumption. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin blocked radiation-induced mTOR mitochondrial relocation and the shift of glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, and reduced the clonogenic survival. In irradiated cells, mTOR formed a complex with Hexokinase II [HK II], a key mitochondrial protein in regulation of glycolysis, causing reduced HK II enzymatic activity. These results support a novel mechanism by which tumor cells can quickly adapt to genotoxic conditions via mTOR-mediated reprogramming of bioenergetics from predominantly aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Such a \"waking-up\" pathway for mitochondrial bioenergetics demonstrates a flexible feature in the energy metabolism of cancer cells, and may be required for additional cellular energy consumption for damage repair and survival. Thus, the reversible cellular energy metabolisms should be considered in blocking tumor metabolism and may be targeted to sensitize them in anti-cancer therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nTwo different bioenergetics pathways are utilized in mammalian cells dependent on oxygen status. When cells have sufficient oxygen, they will metabolize one molecule of glucose into approximately 34 molecules of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondria, producing the major cellular fuels for energy consumption. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions, cells metabolize one molecule of glucose into two molecules of lactate and this energy metabolism can only create two molecules of ATP [ XREF_BIBR ]. In 1956, Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells tend to convert glucose into lactate to produce energy rather than utilizing OXPHOS, even under oxygenated conditions. This phenomenon is called aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. It is believed that tumor cells metabolize glucose to lactate to use the intermediates of glycolysis to support cell proliferation at the expense of producing less energy [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, recent studies indicate that the increase of aerobic glycolysis does not fully replace the mitochondrial functions in cancer cells; they still can increase respiratory activity [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Importantly, it is known that reoxygenation in hypoxic tumors during radiation treatment causes a shift from an hypoxic environment to a more oxygenated condition, due to death of tumor cells and the reconstruction of vasculature [ XREF_BIBR ]. It remains unclear whether aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells is reversible, back to oxidative phosphorylation, under specific genotoxic stress conditions such as ionizing radiation (IR) exposure. Here we report that mTOR, highly expressed in many human tumors [ XREF_BIBR ], plays a key role in switching aerobic glycolysis back to oxidative phosphorylation. This demonstrates a unique mechanism by which cancer cells can generate increased cellular energy, potentially useful as an aid to enhance cellular survival under therapeutic genotoxic stress conditions.\n\nMammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a Serine/Threonine kinase that belongs to the PI3K family. It can regulate an array of cellular functions including protein synthesis, metabolism, and cell proliferation. mTOR has been shown to form two distinct complexes with different functions [ XREF_BIBR ]: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is composed of mTOR, raptor, PRAS40 and mLST8/GbL. It has two well-defined substrates: p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (referred to S6K1) and 4E-BP1, both can regulate protein synthesis [ XREF_BIBR ]. The critical functions of mTORC1 include DNA double-strand break repair [ XREF_BIBR ] and mitochondria function [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], and mTORC1 itself can play a negative feedback role in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway via activation of its substrate, S6K1 that controls the signal influx by inhibiting the receptors when it is activated [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, the feedback system can down-regulate protein synthesis to control cell proliferation. The second complex, mTORC2, is composed of mTOR, rictor, mSIN1, protor, and mLST8 able to phosphorylate Akt, an upstream regulator of mTORC1, to control the signaling pathway [ XREF_BIBR ], suggesting a across-talk between mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC2 has also been indicated in the control of cellular metabolism in glioblastoma via c-Myc regulation [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nMutations in the mTOR signaling pathway have been found in breast and renal cancer [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ] and thus mTOR has been targeted in several clinical trials [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Most of the studies focused on the inhibition of mTOR by using mTOR specific inhibitors, rapamycin and its analogs. However, although these inhibitors are shown to be able to block mTOR activity and inactivate its down-stream substrates to reduce protein synthesis [ XREF_BIBR ], inhibition of mTOR is only significant in vitro, the clinical test for these inhibitors did not show significant treatment improvement [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Currently, it is unknown how these tumor cells are resistant to anti-mTOR treatments. Since mTOR is related to cell energy metabolism, any inhibition or mutation on mTOR can change the way cells produce their energy. It has been well-documented that mTOR dysfunction can transform normal cells into tumor-like cells [ XREF_BIBR ] and switch the energy metabolism from mitochondria-centered oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, a critical question is whether a transformed cell or tumor cell can \"re-use\" mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the necessary cellular bioenergetics for survival if aerobic glycolysis is blocked. Interestingly, mTOR has been detected on the mitochondria surface [ XREF_BIBR ], and inhibition of mTOR can decrease the function of mitochondrial metabolism such as oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential and the TCA cycle [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Here, we provide evidence indicating that under radiation stress, tumor cells can relocate mTOR to mitochondria where it interacts with Hexokinase II, the enzyme that phosphorylates glucose in glycolysis and an inhibitor factor to mitochondrial metabolism [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ], leading to an enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with increased mitochondrial ATP generation. The switch of bioenergetics from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is shown to increase tumor resistance to radiation treatment. Thus, blocking the mitochondrial respiration together with the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis may significantly enhance the effectiveness of current anti-cancer therapy.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nThe location of mTOR is related to cellular bioenergetics.\n\nAs reported by others, aerobic glycolysis observed in many cancer cells may be tracked by its reduced ATP generation and concomitant increase in lactate output. It is thus a potentially useful marker for transformed or tumor cells. Consistent with the features of aerobic glycolysis, the Warburg effect, lowered mitochondrial ATP generation ( XREF_FIG ) and enhanced glycolysis using lactate production as the indicator ( XREF_FIG ), were detected in human colon cancer HCT116, murine breast cancer 4T1 cells and human ovarian SKOV3 xenograft tumor tissue compared with the levels reported in normal cells [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. mTOR is linked to the proliferation of cancer cells and can control the transcription of key enzymes that promote aerobic glycolysis [ XREF_BIBR ]. Inhibition of mTOR is shown to impair the functions of mitochondria and increase lactate production in Jurkat cells [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. We hypothesized that mTOR may have a function in mitochondrial metabolism. However, there was no detectable mTOR proteins in the mitochondrial fractions prepared from the tumor cells and tissues ( XREF_FIG ). Then, we further examined mTOR mitochondrial location and cellular bioenergetics in paired normal and cancer cells, including normal human breast epithelial cells MCF-10A and breast cancer MCF-7 cells; and human prostate epithelial cells 267B1 and their K-Ras transfected derivative, 267B1/Ki (Figs.  XREF_FIG ). Interestingly, the mitochondrial ATP generation was reduced with lowered oxygen consumption in the MCF-7 and 267B1 cells, both of which showed increased level of aerobic glycolysis with enhanced lactate production (Figs.  XREF_FIG ). In contrast, a substantial amount of mTOR proteins was detected in the mitochondrial fraction of MCF-10A cells and 267B1/Ki cells, though there was no difference in the total cellular level of mTOR. These results indicate that the localization of mTOR in mitochondrial is associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).\n\n\n\nRadiation-induced mTOR translocation: an adaptive switch of cellular bioenergetics.\n\nIt is well established that mitochondria in cancer cells are dysfunctional and tumors predominantly use the aerobic glycolysis to produce cellular energy even in an environment with sufficient oxygen [ XREF_BIBR ]. Recent studies, however, indicate that mitochondria in cancer cells still can be reactivated to increase respiratory activity [ XREF_BIBR ]. In this study, we found that cellular bioenergetics can be switched from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS in MCF-7 cells irradiated with a single dose 5 Gy due to mTOR relocation to mitochondria. The mitochondrial mTOR relocation was matched with the time of the highest oxygen consumption and mitochondrial ATP production at 24 h post-irradiation (Figs.  XREF_FIG ). Consistent with the data shown in  XREF_FIG  that mitochondrial mTOR was linked with mitochondrial ATP production and oxygen consumption, the relocation of mTOR to mitochondria after radiation plays a role in mitochondrial bioenergetics that may be required for cellular damage repair and cell survival. To confirm that mitochondrial mTOR was critical for bioenergetics switch we irradiated MCF-7 cells and detected the expression level of mTOR at indicated time points. The total expression of mTOR showed no significant change after 5 Gy of radiation, but at 24 h post-irradiation mTOR relocated to mitochondria ( XREF_FIG ) which was also matched with the enhanced oxygen consumption and mitochondrial ATP generation with lowered lactate production. Flow cytometry was also performed using propidium iodide staining in MCF-7 cells to detect the percentage of G2/M arrest after 5 Gy (Figs.  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY .). Radiation-induced DNA damage elicits a cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase [ XREF_BIBR ]. The flow cytometry data showed that at 24 h post-5 Gy irradiation, most of cells were arrested in G2/M phase and lactate production was decreased, the lowest level at 24 h ( XREF_FIG ). Together, the data show that the translocation of mTOR to mitochondria enhances the switch of aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS at the phase of G2/M arrest following genotoxic stress of ionizing radiation.\n\nTo confirm these findings in MCF7 cells, we repeated the experiment in three different tumor cell lines including human colon cancer HCT116 ( XREF_FIG ), brain tumor U87 ( XREF_FIG ) and murine breast cancer 4T1 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY .). As seen in MCF-7 cells OXPHOS was enhanced at 32 h in HCT116 and 24 h in U87 post-irradiation, times when mTOR relocated to mitochondria in both cell types ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). However, the murine breast cancer 4T1 cells showed both decreased mitochondrial ATP production, and no detectable mTOR translocation to mitochondria after radiation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  Figs.). Parallel results were obtained when 4T1 tumor cells were inoculated into mouse mammary glands and irradiated with 5 Gy of radiation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY .). These results show that the relocation of mTOR to mitochondria after radiation is a key factor regulating mitochondrial functions under genotoxic stress condition and the enhancement of OXPHOS confirms that cancer cells still can use mitochondria to produce energy, particularly under conditions that replicate treatment.\n\n\n\nInhibition of mTOR blocks radiation-induced bioenergetics switch.\n\nNext, we tested whether blocking mTOR could inhibit mTOR-mediated mitochondrial bioenergetics. Rapamycin, a well-characterized inhibitor of mTOR, binds to the FRB domain on mTOR which is believed to be the binding site for mTOR to mitochondria, via FKBP38 on the mitochondria outer surface [ XREF_BIBR ]. We pre-treated MCF-7 cells with 20 ng/ml rapamycin for 30 minutes [ XREF_BIBR ] to inhibit the translocation of mTOR to mitochondria, then irradiated cells with 5 Gy. After rapamycin treatment, the radiation-induced relocation of mTOR to mitochondria was totally blocked ( XREF_FIG ). Similar results were obtained when MCF-7 cells were stained with TOM40 (green), a mitochondria outer membrane protein, and mTOR (red). The images showed that the mTOR and TOM40 co-localized at 24 h after 5 Gy, and rapamycin treatment inhibited this co-localization ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In addition, we measured oxygen consumption, mitochondrial ATP production and lactate production at 24 h after-5 Gy, the peak of mitochondrial function after radiation, and found that cells with rapamycin-blocked mitochondrial mTOR, the bioenergetics cannot switch from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS after radiation (Figs.  XREF_FIG ). Potentially important in clinic, we found that rapamycin pre-treatment increased radiation lethality with about half clonogenicity remained in rapamycin treated cells measured by the clonogenic survival ( XREF_FIG ). These results indicate that mitochondrial mTOR functions as an enhancer for OXPHOS which is required for cellular response to genotoxic stress and survival. The relocation of mTOR to mitochondria is a critical factor that allows cells to reprogram cellular bioenergetics from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS to protect them from radiation injury.\n\n\n\nmTOR/Hexokinase II complex mediates the bioenergetics switch.\n\nTo elucidate the mechanisms controlling the bioenergetics switch after radiation, we co-immunoprecipitated mTOR with another critical mitochondrial protein in glycolysis, Hexokinase II (HK II), to determine whether mTOR mediated mitochondrial bioenergetics is linked with HK II. HK II is in the first step of aerobic glycolysis; it is located on the outer membrane of mitochondria and phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Therefore, it is highly possible that the interaction of mTOR and HK II can serve as a switcher on the mitochondrial surface to initiate the bioenergetics reprogramming. A recent study showed that mTORC1 and HK II formed a complex during glucose starvation in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes [ XREF_BIBR ]. We hypothesized that radiation may trigger an interaction between mTOR and HK II to regulate bioenergetics. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis in MCF-7 cells showed that mTOR did not interact with HK II in sham radiation control cells, but indeed, the mTOR and HK II complex was detected 24 h post-irradiation, the same time point where a switch in energy metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS was detected in MCF-7 cells ( XREF_FIG ). As expected, rapamycin inhibited the translocation of mTOR to mitochondria and prevented the interaction of mTOR and HK II.\n\nThis interaction, which is important for mitochondrial function enhancement, was also tested in mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells. Co-IP showed that the mTOR/HK II complex did not form at 24 h post-irradiation in 4T1 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY .), a finding in accordance with the lack of a radiation-induced switch in bioenergetics for these cells. Thus, these result suggest that the mTOR/HK II interaction is required for promoting mitochondrial function in cancer cells and the regulation of mTOR on HK II is a key factor for the switch. To examine this possibility we measured Hexokinase activity to determine the regulation of mTOR on HK II after 5 Gy ( XREF_FIG ). We found that Hexokinase activity decreased at 24 h post-irradiation, when mTOR interacted with HK II, suggesting that mTOR-mediated inhibition of HK II may act as a biochemical switch of bioenergetics. To confirm that the inhibition of HK II controlled the switch, we treated MCF-7 cells with the HK II inhibitor, 3-BrPA ( XREF_FIG ). 3-BrPA can prevent the binding of HK II to mitochondria and inhibit the ability of HK II to phosphorylate glucose. We found that HK II activity was decreased at 24 h post-irradiation and further reduced by 3-BrPA treatment. The increase of mitochondrial ATP production was in accordance with the results obtained by rapamycin treatment in MCF-7 cells.\n\nOur previous study showed that after low dose radiation, HK II can move into the mitochondrial matrix and interact with MnSOD [ XREF_BIBR ]. We co-immunoprecipitated HK II and MnSOD in MCF-7 cells treated with rapamycin and/or radiation ( XREF_FIG ) and found that at 24 h post-irradiation, relocation of mTOR to mitochondria can prevent the influx of HK II into the mitochondrial matrix to form a complex with MnSOD. However, rapamycin treatment can rescue the HK II influx. HK II interaction with MnSOD results in reduced MnSOD activity ( XREF_FIG ) which may lead to higher ROS production and cell death. By blocking the interaction between HK II and MnSOD, mTOR enables the proper activation of MnSOD, which is required to scavenge elevated ROS resulting from enhanced OXPHOS. These results support the conclusion that the inhibitory function of mTOR on HK II can be induced by radiation and serves as a switch to turn mitochondrial functions on or off. Thus blocking this interaction may result in the inhibition of the acute adaptive response and cell survival under genotoxic stress condition caused by 5 Gy of radiation.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nThis report reveals a mechanism by which tumor cells are able to rapidly shift from aerobic glycolysis (Warburg Effect), to mitochondrial respiration after radiation exposure. As a result, cells will consume glucose more efficiently and generate more ATP following such genotoxic stressors by relocating mTOR to mitochondria. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been proven to be a central factor regulating cell proliferation, protein synthesis and cell survival [ XREF_BIBR ]. In many cancer cells, mTOR is highly expressed [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] leading to the induction of several proteins that regulate aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. We compared two pairs of cell lines, MCF-10A and MCF-7, and 267B1 and 267B1/Ki, and found that the distribution of mitochondrial mTOR in cells was related to cellular metabolism status but not cell types. These results indicate that mitochondrial mTOR may not be a feature unique to tumor cells, but an opportunistic reprogramming of cellular metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative respiration, potentially providing extra energy to address genotoxic changes, enhancing tumor cell survival.\n\nTherapeutic ionizing radiation can induce DNA damage and kill tumor cells, but tumors can still survive under this stress condition. Here, we found that radiation can induce the translocation of mTOR to mitochondria and induce changes in bioenergetics status following genotoxic stress. The mTOR-mediated metabolism switch in cancer cells provides a novel focus for the dynamic reprogramming of cellular bioenergetics. This may assist in the adaptation to changes in environmental conditions and, as our results show, may be linked to increased radiation resistance. In this context, pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, blocks the relocation of mTOR to mitochondria that we suggest inhibits the switch in bioenergetics after irradiation. Therefore, cells cannot switch metabolism to protect cells from the stress condition. The key role of mTOR in triggering the reprogramming of bioenergetics is seen in murine 4T1 cells, where the lack of a switch in bioenergetics status is associated with no mTOR accumulation on mitochondria. Therefore, not all tumors tested showed the ability of switching glycolysis to OXPHOS, supporting a key role for mitochondrial mTOR in \"waking up\" mitochondrial metabolic activity following genotoxic stress.\n\nIt has been well-established that reoxygenation of hypoxic regions occurs in irradiated tumors, probably due to the reduced oxygen demand from dead and dying cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. Reoxygenation of hypoxic regions in tumors is important in that a lack of molecular oxygen reduces the fixation of free radical mediated damage, increasing the resistance of cells to irradiation. Such damage fixation is a rapid event, of the order of microseconds, and thus is likely separate from any change in bioenergetics that will proceed much more slowly. Our recent studies also showed that radiation can induce mitochondrial protein influx (MPI), such as CDK 1, to enhance mitochondrial functions for adaptive response. The mitochondrial influx CDK1 can promote the activity of OXPHOS to induce anti-apoptotic response [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Although the replacement of mitochondrial respiration by aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells has been generally accepted, the partial activation of mitochondrial functions in tumors has only recently been reported [ XREF_BIBR ], the overloading of the electron transport chain and increased mitochondrial superoxide activity may promote cancer metastasis [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. It is unknown whether tumor cells can utilize the increased oxygen for their cellular fuel supplement by converting glycolysis-mediated energy to the mitochondria-centered, oxygen-consuming ATP generation. Our study provide the first evidence indicating that a dynamic feature of reprogramming cellular bioenergetics is present in tumor cells, and a potential important factor that mediates such shifting in tumor bioenergetics from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration is mTOR. Thus the mitochondria in tumor cells can be reactivated, or \"awakened\", a feature we describe here as the \"Warburg-Reversing Effect\", a process active during genotoxic stress, such as exposure to ionizing radiation. Radiation combined with rapamycin treatment has been studied before, where the combined treatment can enhance radiation sensitivity [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Our results provide a mechanism for such sensitization whereby rapamycin treatment before radiation can prevent the relocation of mTOR to mitochondria. The relocation of mTOR is critical for the adaptive switch of bioenergetics in tumors enabling them to survive genotoxic stress.\n\nIn order to examine the possible mechanism of rapamycin sensitization linked to mTOR, we focused on one of its possible targets, Hexokinase II (HK II). HK II is highly activated in cancer cells and is located on the outer membrane of mitochondria where it phosphorylates glucose in the first step of glycolysis [ XREF_BIBR ]. It contains three (ST)Q motifs that can be phosphorylated by PIKK family members and mTOR belongs to this kinase family [ XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, mTOR may be able to phosphorylate HK II and regulate its activity. Study has shown that under starvation conditions, HK II can interact with mTORC1 to induce autophagy in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Therefore, the interaction of mTOR and HK II may be a factor to regulate cell survival under stress [ XREF_BIBR ]. Our data showed that mTOR can directly interact with HK II to form a mTOR/HK II complex on mitochondria after 5 Gy. This interaction of mTOR and HK II can serve as a mitochondrial-based switch to convert energy metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS by inhibiting HK II activity. In support of this argument we showed that 3-BrPA, an HK II inhibitor, can prevent the binding of HK II to mitochondria and inhibit its activity in glycolysis. The inhibition of HK II after radiation can prevent HK II influx into mitochondrial matrix. In our studies we showed that after irradiation, mTOR relocates to mitochondrial outer membrane and binds to HK II, this interaction may dissociate HK II from mitochondria and inhibits its activity. The removal of HK II from mitochondria may turn on respiratory activity after radiation induced genotoxic stress condition and shift aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS in order to produce sufficient ATP for DNA repair ( XREF_FIG ). In  XREF_FIG , our clonogenic survival experiment showed that rapamycin treated cells had a lower survival, potentially caused by the influx of HK II into the mitochondrial matrix. When rapamycin inhibits mTOR relocation to mitochondria, removing its interaction with HK II, HK II can then interact with MnSOD, inhibiting its function after irradiation, as seen in  XREF_FIG . Thus the normal radical scavenging function of MnSOD is inhibited, increasing cell damage and thus cell death [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn summary, this work provides the evidence supporting a unique metabolic mechanism by which tumor cells can quickly shift their major energy metabolism from the aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration by relocating mTOR to mitochondria and inhibiting HK II activity. The inhibition of HK II function can slow down the aerobic glycolysis and increase OXPHOS activity which is required to increase tumor cell survival under genotoxic stress conditions. The dynamics of tumor cell bioenergetics under genotoxic stress conditions, especially the mTOR-mediated inhibition of glycolysis in tumor adaptive resistance needs to be further investigated.\n\n",
