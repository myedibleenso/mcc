      "text":"Overexpression of PAK1 Promotes Cell Survival in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Colitis-associated Cancer.\n\n\n\nArticle first published online 7 January 2015.\n\nSupplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text.\n\n\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are characterized by chronic gut inflammation associated with architectural distortion of intestinal epithelium and impaired mucosal barrier functions. Chronic gut inflammation also disposes to an increased risk of colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Mesalamine (5-ASA; 5-aminosalicylic acid) is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of UC with therapeutic benefits in mucosal healing and consequently impeding colon carcinogenesis. It has been demonstrated that in addition to reduction of oxidative stress, XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  5-ASA acts through induction of cell cycle arrest, XREF_BIBR  increases PPAR-gamma, XREF_BIBR  reduces PI3K/AKT and beta-catenin signaling, XREF_BIBR  and facilitates membranous expression of E-cadherin through modulation of N-glycosylation. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  This confers 5-ASA with chemopreventive potential, which remains controversial in the meta-analyses. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  We performed a microarray analysis on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to investigate targets of 5-ASA and PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) emerged as its consensus target that orchestrates Wnt/beta-catenin, MAP kinase pathways, and cell adhesion interfered by 5-ASA.\n\nPAK1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase implicated in multiple pathways through its kinase activity and scaffolding functions. XREF_BIBR  Besides its role in antiapoptotic signaling, PAK1 is critical for cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility and EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition). XREF_BIBR  Moreover, PAK1 signaling contributes in combating gastrointestinal viral/microbial infections. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  In CRC, PAK1 expression is found to be amplified with the disease progression, XREF_BIBR  and accumulating evidence establish its role in the promotion of colon carcinogenesis. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  However, the cause of PAK1 overexpression throughout disease initiation and progression is currently unclear.\n\nIn contrast to sporadic CRC, cellular pathways contributing to progression from chronic inflammation to CAC are primarily driven by activation of proinflammatory signaling such as NF-kappaB, JNK, and p38MAPK. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  Although, PAK1 is implicated in the activation of NF-kappaB, XREF_BIBR  knowledge is lacking about role of PAK1 in intestinal inflammation and homeostasis. XREF_BIBR  Interestingly, the small GTPase RAC1 is associated with the susceptibility and development of colitis, XREF_BIBR  and PAK1 is one of its critical downstream effector molecules. In CAC, p53 and K-Ras mutations are early events in the progression from colitis to cancer. K-Ras activation propagates growth factor signaling through Raf/MEK/ERK cascade or through PI3K/AKT, and PAK1 contributes to both ERK and AKT pathways to promote tumor growth. XREF_BIBR \n\nHere, we examined the expression of PAK1 in IBD and CAC. Using normal diploid human colon epithelial cells (HCEC-1CT), we investigated the regulation of PAK1 expression in intestinal epithelium through overexpression and inhibition.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\nPAK1 Is Overexpressed in IBD and CAC and Contributes to Cell Proliferation and Survival.\n\nPatient samples were analyzed for PAK1 expression by immunohistochemistry in CD, UC, and CAC (as described in Methods) and compared with normal mucosa. In normal colonic tissue, epithelial PAK1 expression was low, whereas PAK1 expression was comparatively higher in the samples from patients with CD and UC                       and was mostly cytoplasmic. PAK1 immunoreactivity increased further in CAC. These observations suggest that PAK1 overexpression is an early event in the disease progression from colitis to CAC.\n\nTo investigate the functional effect of PAK1 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells, HCEC-1CT was transfected with control (Con) and wild-type (PAK1-WT) expression vectors, and cell proliferation was analyzed. HCEC-1CT showed higher proliferation (46% +/- 3.1%) on overexpression of PAK1-WT compared with control                   . Apoptosis (Annexin V positive cells) was reduced in HCEC-1CT overexpressing PAK1-WT (0.96% +/- 2.8%) compared with control (16.1% +/- 6.2%)                   .\n\n\n\nAKT1 and mTOR Pathways Are Activated in IBD.\n\nTo investigate the activation of cell proliferation and survival pathways associated with PAK1 overexpression in IBD and CAC, MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR pathways were examined. Immunohistochemistry was performed on these samples with p-ERK1/2, p-AKT (Thr 308), and p-mTOR (Ser 2448) for activation of respective pathways. Both p-mTOR                       and p-AKT                       levels were increased in the epithelium from IBD samples and exhibited nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. However, only p-AKT1 was increased further in CAC                  . Noticeably, p-mTOR staining was predominantly nuclear in both IBD and CAC. Expression of p-ERK1/2 was also examined; however, expression was not altered either in IBD or CAC compared with controls                                                                          .\n\n\n\nPAK1 Contributes to PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and mTOR Pathways in Colon Epithelial Cells.\n\nIt was clear that PAK1 overexpression in HCEC-1CT contributes to cell proliferation and survival. Western blot analysis was performed on PAK1 overexpressing HCEC-1CT cells to examine activation of cell proliferation/survival pathways                   . 5-ASA was effective in reducing PAK1 expression. However, PAK1 overexpression did not induce any change in p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, or p-mTOR                                                                          ; indicating that neither of these pathways was affected by PAK1 overexpression per se. This suggested that PAK1 might be contributing downstream of these molecules.\n\nTo assess if PAK1 is downstream of these pathways, HCEC-1CT cells were treated with specific inhibitors (U0126/LY294002/rapamycin) of these respective pathways (MEK/PI3K/mTOR) in the presence or absence of 5-ASA. Interestingly, PAK1 expression was reduced by all inhibitors tested                    indicating these pathways regulate PAK1 in HCEC-1CT. There was no additional effect of 5-ASA on PAK1 inhibition in the presence of LY294002 and U0126. However, in rapamycin-treated cells, PAK1 inhibition was more pronounced on combination with 5-ASA, indicating inhibition of additional pathway regulating PAK1. Western blot for effector molecules of these pathways (p-AKT (308), p-mTOR, and p-ERK1/2) showed that 5-ASA inhibits p-AKT1 and p-mTOR. This explained that the additional effect of 5-ASA on PAK1 inhibition on rapamycin treatment was through inhibition of p-AKT. Overall, these data indicated that in HCEC-1CT, 5-ASA uses either of these pathways resulting in PAK1 inhibition.\n\nTo assess the effect of these inhibitors on the functional consequence of PAK1 overexpression, cell proliferation analysis was performed on PAK1 overexpressing cells. As was expected, all inhibitors reduced cell proliferation in the control where cells were transfected with empty vector                   . However, in PAK1 overexpressing HCEC-1CT, compared with MEK inhibitor U0126, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin were more effective in counteracting the increased cell proliferation on PAK1-WT overexpression. These data suggested that blocking mTOR and PI3K signaling can antagonize functional consequence of PAK1 overexpression.\n\nInhibition of p-AKT1 and mTOR by 5-ASA has not been investigated in normal colon epithelial cells previously. We further examined the effect of 5-ASA on mTORC1 and mTORC2 and performed Western blot analysis of p-mTOR, raptor (representing mTORC1 complex), rictor (representing mTORC2 complex), and AKT phosphorylation (Ser473, Thr 308). 5-ASA and rapamycin inhibited p-mTOR and raptor                   . In rapamycin pretreated cells, 5-ASA further inhibited raptor expression. Since, mTOR in complex with rictor (mTORC2) has been identified as PDK2 phosphorylating AKT at Ser473, XREF_BIBR  we examined the effect of 5-ASA on Ser473-AKT phosphorylation. Ser473-p-AKT was increased on 5-ASA and rapamycin treatment indicating activation of feedback loop reported earlier. XREF_BIBR  5-ASA, however, inhibited p-AKT1 (Thr 308) as was observed previously                   . These observations suggest that 5-ASA inhibits mTOR through inhibition of AKT (Thr 308) phosphorylation and potentiates the effect of rapamycin on mTORC1 inhibition.\n\n\n\nPAK1 Interacts with beta-Catenin in Colon Epithelial Cells and Its Overexpression Correlates with beta-catenin Expression in CRC Cell Lines.\n\nTo investigate somatic mutations that might drive PAK1 overexpression, we examined PAK1 expression in a panel of CRC cell lines                                                                            . Normal diploid HCEC-1CT and-2CT cells XREF_BIBR  were also included for the comparison. CRC cell lines mutated in K-Ras (DLD-1, LoVo, HCT116) and p53 (HT29, HCT116 p53 -/- ) expressed higher levels of PAK1 compared with HCEC-1CT and 2-CT and RKO                   . In CRC, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway contributes to cell proliferation and survival; therefore, beta-catenin levels were also examined in this panel. It was interesting to note that PAK1 overexpression was associated with increased beta-catenin expression in these cell lines (r = +0.665; Pearson's correlation).\n\nInhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin is a known mechanism of 5-ASA activity. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  PAK1 contributes to this pathway by phosphorylating beta-catenin and facilitating its nuclear localization. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  Immunofluorescence was performed on CRC cells to examine the PAK1-beta-catenin localization. HT29 and HCT116 cells displayed both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression and colocalization of PAK1 and beta-catenin                   . 5-ASA treatment reduced beta-catenin and PAK1 in the nucleus and disrupted their interaction and colocalization. Moreover, as reported previously, 5-ASA induced membranous localization of beta-catenin. XREF_BIBR  The interaction between PAK1 and beta-catenin was also tested in HCEC-1CT                   . PAK1 was mostly cytoplasmic, whereas beta-catenin was both membranous and cytoplasmic. PAK1 colocalized with beta-catenin in the cytoplasm                   . A dose-dependent effect of 5-ASA was observed on PAK1-beta catenin expression and localization. 5-ASA treatment increased membranous beta-catenin and decreased cytoplasmic PAK1 and beta-catenin. PAK1 was also detected in beta-catenin immunoprecipitate and treatment with 5-ASA abolished this interaction likely due to reduction in total beta-catenin and PAK1                                                                            .\n\nNext, we examined the effect of PAK1 inhibition on cellular proliferation in PAK1 overexpressing CRC cells. Cell proliferation was decreased on inhibition of PAK1 on 5-ASA treatment and silencing PAK1 using siRNA                    or inhibition of kinase activity using IPA3                   . HCT116 and HT29 exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation on IPA3 treatment                   . Normal HCEC-1CT cells were rather resistant to IPA3 and a higher dose of IPA3 (20 muM) resulted in cytotoxicity                                                                            .\n\n5-ASA has been previously shown to interfere with the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  To further examine whether 5-ASA and targeted inhibition of PAK1 (by silencing PAK1 with siRNA) have similar molecular effects, ERK1/2 and AKT1 phosphorylation was examined in CRC cells (HT-29). Cells treated with 5-ASA exhibited decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p-AKT                   . Silencing PAK1 (siPAK1) elicited similar effect as 5-ASA, suggesting that molecular effects of 5-ASA on ERK1/2 and AKT1 phosphorylation are mediated by inhibition of PAK1. These observations led us to conclude that in CRC cells, PAK1 contributes to MEK and AKT signaling and 5-ASA likely downregulates both pathways through inhibition of PAK1.\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nIn this study, PAK1 was found to be overexpressed in the intestinal epithelium of IBD and CAC. Functional consequences of PAK1 overexpression were examined in primary colonic epithelial cells (overexpressing WT-PAK1), and the data demonstrated that PAK1 overexpression stimulated cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. When examined for the activation of growth pathways in parallel to PAK1 expression, IBD and CAC samples showed an increase in epithelial AKT1 and mTOR phosphorylation suggesting that activation of AKT/mTOR pathway and PAK1 overexpression are early events in the disease progression to cancer. Our data demonstrating an association and interaction of PAK1 with beta-catenin in primary colonic epithelium suggests its role in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and intestinal homeostasis. 5-ASA treatment effectively inhibited PAK1 on overexpression and also AKT and mTOR activation. Taken together, the data demonstrate that PAK1 is overexpressed in IBD and CAC, contributing to AKT/mTOR cell survival pathway, and implicates it as a target of 5-ASA                  .\n\nIn the absence of oncogenic signaling, what drives PAK1 overexpression is not yet clear as PAK1 acts as a scaffolding protein and a nodal kinase in multiple signaling cascades. XREF_BIBR  PAK1 overexpression in IBD and CAC might be a direct influence of proinflammatory cytokines as preliminary findings suggest that PAK1 contributes to TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling. XREF_BIBR  It is known that TNF-alpha signaling activates AKT for NF-kappaB activation, XREF_BIBR  and PAK1 might be another player in the activation of NF-kappaB pathway. It was previously shown that expression of active PAK1 in NIH3T3 cells stimulated NF-kappaB through nuclear translocation of p65. XREF_BIBR  It is likely that inflammation-driven PAK1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and survival contributing to PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling, which is activated in IBD, as was observed in this study. However, role of stress-activated signaling cascade (SAPK/JNK/p38) and regulation of PAK1 requires further investigation in the context of chronic gut inflammation.\n\nActivation of mTOR pathway in IBD has not been clearly demonstrated, although mTOR activity has been recently implicated in impairment of epithelial autophagy in IBD. XREF_BIBR  We observed an increased mTOR activity in IBD but not in CAC indicating that unlike PAK1 and p-AKT, mTOR activation was not sustained throughout the disease progression. Interestingly, p-mTOR was found to be mostly nuclear both in IBD and CAC. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of mTOR has been implicated in the activation of its targets eIF4E and S6K1, XREF_BIBR  involved in the initiation of translation and protein synthesis and thereby promoting cell growth and survival.\n\nBoth, PI3K and MAPK signaling regulate mTORC function. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  In HCEC, overexpression of PAK1 per se did not activate either of these pathways; however, downregulation of PAK1 by inhibitors of these pathways indicates that PAK1 expression is regulated downstream of these molecules. This implicates that PAK1 contributes to these prosurvival pathways in colonic epithelium which are activated in response to mucosal insult. In CRC, as a consequence of activation of oncogenic signaling, PAK1 activity might be critical in tumor progression. Multiple signaling pathways including Wnt/beta-catenin, ERK, and AKT exhibit diminished activation in the PAK1-knockout mice and on inhibition of PAK1 in CRC cells, XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  supporting its role in full activation of these pathways.\n\nThis study provides a novel insight of signaling pathways regulating PAK1 expression in colon epithelial cells that can be used for targeting PAK1 overexpression in gastrointestinal diseases including IBD and CRC. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathway can potentially curtail PAK1 activity and inhibition of PAK1 can impair AKT/mTOR activation. Remarkably enough, 5-ASA inhibited both of these pathways. In the context of UC and CAC, 5-ASA has been previously shown to reduce p-AKT. XREF_BIBR  In CRC cells, 5-ASA caused phospholipase-D dependent loss of mTOR signaling. XREF_BIBR  We have previously identified eIF4b and IF4e as targets of 5-ASA, which are members of the cellular translation machinery regulated by PI3K/mTOR. XREF_BIBR  Nevertheless, activation (and potential inhibition) of the mTOR pathway in IBD warrants further investigations.\n\nAs a component of adherens junctions and canonical Wnt signaling, beta-catenin serves a dual role in intestinal physiology. It has been recently demonstrated that in CRC cells, PAK1 phosphorylates beta-catenin and promotes its nuclear functions, whereas PAK1 inhibition increased intercellular adhesion through membranous translocation of beta-catenin and E-cadherin. XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  Since, PI3K/AKT signaling is known to activate beta-catenin transcriptional activity, it is seemly possible that PAK1 cooperates with PI3K/AKT signaling to sustain Wnt/beta-catenin activity. Our data in HCEC-1CT demonstrate an interaction of PAK1 and beta-catenin and substantiates physiological relevance of such association in normal colon epithelial cells. Disruption of this interaction by 5-ASA might contribute to downregulation of nuclear functions of beta-catenin, thereby inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling and consequently promoting membranous translocation of beta-catenin at adherens junctions. This activity of 5-ASA is in accordance to its clinical benefit in UC. It can be speculated that as a multifunctional kinase, PAK1 might have additional roles in the regulation of gut homeostasis including epithelial-stromal interactions and epithelial-mesenchymal transition during epithelial restitution.\n\nOverexpression of PAK1 in IBD and CAC is a novel finding that implicates PAK1 in chronic gut inflammation. Since PAK1 overexpression is an early event in disease progression from colitis to cancer, it can be used as a predictive marker of disease activity and remission. Activation of survival pathways and an increase in cellular proliferation as a consequence of PAK1 overexpression makes PAK1 a viable target for chemoprevention in inflammation-driven colon cancer. This study also underscores the molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory drug 5-ASA that can confer chemopreventive benefits in CAC. Specific targeting of PAK1 may open an alternative approach in the treatment of IBD.\n\n",
