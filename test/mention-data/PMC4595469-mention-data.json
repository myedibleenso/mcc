      "text":"Contrasting Effects of the Cytotoxic Anticancer Drug Gemcitabine and the EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Gefitinib on NK Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity via Regulation of NKG2D Ligand in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nSeveral cytotoxic anticancer drugs inhibit DNA replication and/or mitosis, while EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors inactivate EGFR signalling in cancer cell. Both types of anticancer drugs improve the overall survival of the patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although tumors often become refractory to this treatment. Despite several mechanisms by which the tumors become resistant having been described the effect of these compounds on anti-tumor immunity remains largely unknown.\n\n\n\nMethods.\n\nThis study examines the effect of the cytotoxic drug Gemcitabine and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib on the expression of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands as well as the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the NK-mediated lysis.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\nWe demonstrate that Gemcitabine treatment leads to an enhanced expression, while Gefitinib downregulated the expression of molecules that act as key ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D and promote NK cell-mediated recognition and cytolysis. Gemcitabine activated ATM and ATM- and Rad-3-related protein kinase (ATR) pathways. The Gemcitabine-induced phosphorylation of ATM as well as the upregulation of the NKG2D ligand expression could be blocked by an ATM-ATR inhibitor. In contrast, Gefitinib attenuated NKG2D ligand expression. Silencing EGFR using siRNA or addition of the PI3K inhibitor resulted in downregulation of NKG2D ligands. The observations suggest that the EGFR/PI3K pathway also regulates the expression of NKG2D ligands. Additionally, we showed that both ATM-ATR and EGFR regulate MICA/B via miR20a.\n\n\n\nConclusion.\n\nIn keeping with the effect on NKG2D expression, Gemcitabine enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity while Gefitinib attenuated NK cell killing in NSCLC cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nLung cancer ranks as the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause globally of cancer-related mortality [ XREF_BIBR ]. Despite improvement in clinical outcomes patients with disseminated disease have a poor prognosis. Cytotoxic anticancer therapy has improved overall survival of patients with non-resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [ XREF_BIBR ]. Additionally, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) have increased the median survival time of advanced patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC to >24 months [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, both types of drugs however can give rise to refractory tumors.\n\nIt is established that the development and progression of tumors might be caused by their escape from immune surveillance and destruction by the host immunity. NK cells play an important role in immunosurveillance [ XREF_BIBR ]. The NK cell activity is promoted via the NK group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptors on NK cells and the engagement of NKG2D with its ligands enhances the cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine release [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. In contrast, NK cell activity could be inhibited by the interaction of the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) on NK cells with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules thereby preventing cytotoxicity against normal self [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. An important NKG2D ligand is the MHC class I chain A and B (MICA and MICB) [ XREF_BIBR ] and UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs) [ XREF_BIBR ], which are expressed at low levels on the non-malignant cell types while primary tumor cells and tumor cell lines frequently express NKG2D ligands [ XREF_BIBR ]. The mechanisms that control the expression of NKG2D ligands are poorly understood. Improving the knowledge of NKG2D ligand expression is important, since it is well established that NKG2D ligands play an important role in the recognition of tumor cells by NK cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, tumor cells expressing NKG2D ligand can become susceptible to NK cell killing even in the presence of normal MHC class I expression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, the balance between NKG2D ligands and MHC class I expression on transformed cells is important for their survival during immune surveillance of their host [ XREF_BIBR ]. Even so tumor cells could evade immune recognition by downregulating NKG2D ligands expression.\n\nThe NKG2D ligands have been described as stress-related proteins, which can be induced by activation of the DNA damage pathway induced by ionizing radiation and inhibitors of DNA replication [ XREF_BIBR ]. The underlying molecular mechanisms of modulating NKG2D ligand expression are diverse. A direct control of MICA by the BCR/ABL oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia had been described [ XREF_BIBR ], while the HER2-HER3 signalling was involved in the regulation of MICA/B expression in breast cancer cell lines [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Recently, there exists evidence that microRNAs (miRs), such as miR20a, miR-93, miR-106b, miR-372 and miR-520d could have been described to control the constitutive and/or IFN-gamma-induced expression of NKG2D ligands in tumor and virus-infected cells [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], and the knock down of the miR biogenesis enzyme DICER upregulated MICA/B expression [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nCytotoxic anticancer drugs inhibit DNA replication [ XREF_BIBR ] or mitosis [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ] resulting in apoptosis in several types of cancers including NSCLC [ XREF_BIBR ], while EGFR-TKI inactivates EGFR signalling in NSCLC cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. Since the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is regulated by the balance between activating and inhibiting signals,[ XREF_BIBR ] it is of particular interest to understand if cytotoxic anticancer drugs and EGFR-TKI affect the expression of activating NK cell receptors in NSCLC cells. In this report, we demonstrate that Gemcitabine upregulates NKG2D ligand expression on tumor cells via the activation of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ATM-and Rad-3-related protein kinases (ATR) pathway resulting in an enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, while Gefitinib downregulates NKG2D ligands expression via inhibition of the EGFR/PI3K signalling thereby hindering NK cell killing. These findings emphasize the importance of immune selection and immune escape in addition to drug resistance for the progress of NSCLC.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nConstitutive expression of MHC class I molecules MICA, MICB, ULBP-1, ULBP-2/5/6 and ULBP-3 in NSCLC cell lines.\n\nThe basal expressions levels of MHC class I molecules and the different NKG2D ligands MICA, MICB, ULBP-1, ULBP-2/5/6 and ULBP-3 were determined in 5 NSCLC cell lines using flow cytometry. As shown in  XREF_FIG , ULBP-2/5/6 was commonly expressed in all NSCLC lines analyzed. Both MICA and ULBP-1 were expressed in 4 of 5 cell lines, but the expression level of ULBP-1 was low. In contrast, both MICB and ULBP-3 were expressed in only 2 of 5 cell lines, but MICB is highly expressed in RERF-LC-AI cells. Based on the expression pattern we focused on the expressions of MICA, MICB and ULBP-2/5/6 for subsequent experiments.\n\n\n\nCytotoxic anticancer drugs enhanced MICA/B and ULBPs expressions in NSCLC cells.\n\nWe next examined the effect of the cytotoxic reagents on the proliferation of NSCLC cells using the WST assay demonstrating that A549 cells were resistant to several cytotoxic reagents compared with other cell lines ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). To analyze the ability of cytotoxic anticancer drugs to influence the MHC class I antigen and NKG2D ligand expression, the 5 NSCLC cell lines were left untreated (NT) or treated with 1 or 10 nM of Gemcitabine, Pemetrexed, Docetaxel, or Vinorelbine, respectively, for 24 hours before the expression of each molecule was assessed. Gemcitabine upregulated the expression of MHC class I molecules, MICA, and ULBP-2/5/6 in A549 cells ( XREF_FIG ), and the expression of MICA, MICB, and ULBP-2/5/6 in RERF-LC-AI cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Docetaxel upregulated MHC class I molecules in A549 cells ( XREF_FIG ), ULBP-2/5/6 in RERF-LC-AI ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), and both MICB and ULBP-2/5/6 in PC-9 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Neither Pemetrexed nor Vinorelbine could enhance the expression of both MHC class I molecules and NKG2D ligands in these 3 cell lines ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) and we could not see any effect on the expression of MHC class I molecules and NKG2D ligands in neither RERF-LC-KJ nor LC2/ad cells treated with any of the cytotoxic drugs ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\n\n\nGemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligand expression is regulated by DNA stress-induced ATM-ATR signalling.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that NKG2D ligand expression can be induced by activation of the DNA stress sensing ATM-ATR [ XREF_BIBR ] or the NKG2D ligand gene transcription via oxidative stress [ XREF_BIBR ]. To determine whether ATM-ATR pathways regulate the NKG2D ligand expression in NSCLC, A549 cells were treated with the ATM-ATR inhibitors Caffeine [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ] or KU55933 [ XREF_BIBR ]. In concordance with recently published reports [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ], the baseline expression of NKG2D ligands was downregulated by Caffeine, but was not downregulated by KU55933 or by the anti-oxidative reagent NAC in A549 cells ( XREF_FIG ). The upregulation of NKG2D ligands which was observed in A549 cells following 24 hour exposure to 10 nM of Gemcitabine ( XREF_FIG ) was blocked both by Caffeine and KU55933 treatment but marginal effect by NAC ( XREF_FIG ), suggested that Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligand was mainly regulated by ATM-ATR pathway but not by oxidative stress. In subsequent experiments, we explored whether the ATM-ATR signalling would affect NKG2D ligand expression to delineate why Caffeine blocked both basal and Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligands while KU55933 blocked only Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligands. Flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylated ATM showed that the ATM-ATR inhibitors KU55933 clearly blocked phosphorylation of ATM, while Caffeine had a smaller effect on basal ( XREF_FIG ) and Gemcitabine-induced ( XREF_FIG ) phosphorylation of ATM than KU55933. To investigate this further, the expression of NKG2D ligands were analyzed in A549 cells treated with ATM-specific siRNA. As shown by Western blot analysis, the ATM expression in A549 cells was diminished by ATM siRNA ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In line with the experiments using the ATM inhibitor KU55933, ATM-specific siRNA did not decrease basal expression of NKG2D ligands, but clearly blocked Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligands in A549 cells ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nIt has been reported that Caffeine inhibits ATM-ATR pathway [ XREF_BIBR ] as well as PI3K pathway [ XREF_BIBR ], which are also known as regulators of NKG2D ligands [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Our findings suggested that the Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligands were mainly regulated via ATM-ATR pathway, but basal expression of NKG2D ligand is regulated via other mechanisms.\n\n\n\nGefitinib downregulated NKG2D ligands expression via blocking the downstream signalling of EGFR, mainly PI3K-AKT pathway.\n\nNext, the ability of the EGFR-TKI Gefitinib was examined for its ability to influence MHC class I antigen and NKG2D ligand expression in these cell lines. Although it was previously reported that 10 muM of Gefitinib upregulated NKG2D ligands in lung cancer cell lines [ XREF_BIBR ], pharmacokinetic analysis showed the serum concentration of Gefitinib reached less than 1 muM in the clinical setting [ XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore we assessed the influence of Gefitinib at 1 muM on NKG2D ligand expression. Both PC-9 ( XREF_FIG ) and A549 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) expressed EGFR, but PC-9 is sensitive ( XREF_FIG ), while A549 is resistant to Gefitinib ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In line with a previous report [ XREF_BIBR ], Gefitinib upregulated the expression of MHC class I antigens in both PC-9 and A549 cells. Surprisingly, Gefitinib downregulated the basal expressions of MICB and ULBP-2/5/6 in PC-9 cells ( XREF_FIG ) and MICA in A549 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), although Gefitinib did not show any effect in the other carcinoma lines tested ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nTo further assess and confirm the influence of EGFR signalling on the expression of NKG2D ligands, EGFR expression was silenced in both PC-9 and A549 cells using RNAi. The expressions of EGFR in both cell lines were diminished by EGFR siRNA as measured by Western blot, which was accompanied by the inhibition of the phosphorylation of EGFR in PC-9 cells ( XREF_FIG ) and A549 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In line with previous reports [ XREF_BIBR ], EGFR siRNA upregulated the expression of MHC class I molecule, while a significant downregulation of the expression of MICB and ULBP-2/5/6 was observed in PC-9 cells ( XREF_FIG ) and the downregulation of MICA in A549 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These findings suggested that the EGFR directly regulated the expression of NKG2D ligands. It has been previously demonstrated that the oncogenes BCL/ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia [ XREF_BIBR ] and HER3 in breast cancer [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ] regulated NKG2D ligands expression via PI3K/AKT signalling. EGFR-TKI therapies improve the outcome of NSCLC patients while EGFR driver mutations help cell survival and proliferation [ XREF_BIBR ]. Since the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/MAPK pathways are the major downstream pathways of EGFR signaling [ XREF_BIBR ], we evaluated whether these pathways regulate the expression of NKG2D ligands in the NSCLC cells. PC-9 cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 [ XREF_BIBR ] or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 [ XREF_BIBR ]. In line with our earlier findings with the breast carcinoma cell lines [ XREF_BIBR ], LY294002 strongly downregulated NKG2D ligands, but PD98059 showed smaller effect than LY294002 on the expression of NKG2D ligands in both A549 ( XREF_FIG ) and PC-9 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) suggesting that the EGFR signalling maintained the basal expression of NKG2D ligands via mainly PI3K-AKT pathway in both 2 cell lines.\n\nGemcitabine enhanced the expression of NKG2D ligands, while Gefitinib attenuated them in A549 cells. Since combination therapy regimens are useful in clinic, A549 cells were treated with both Gemcitabine and Gefitinib for 24 hours. As expected the combination treatment of Gemcitabine and Gefitinib enhanced the expression of MHC class I antigens, while the Gemcitabine induced MICA/B reverted by co-treatment with Gefitinib in A549 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\n\n\nBoth ATM-ATR and EGFR pathway regulated MICA/B expression via miR20a.\n\nRecently miRNA has been demonstrated to downregulate the expression of several molecules including NKG2D ligands [ XREF_BIBR ]. In order to determine whether ATM-ATR or EGFR signalling regulates NKG2D ligand expression by miRNA, the copy number of miRNA was assessed in NSCLC cells treated with Gemcitabine or Gefitinib. Interestingly, miR10b and miR20a expression decreased in both A549 ( XREF_FIG ) and RERF-LC-AI cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) treated with Gemcitabine, suggesting that Gemcitabine-induced ATM-ATR signalling regulates NKG2D ligand expression via miR10b and miR20a. On the other hand, Gefitinib upregulated miR20a in PC-9 cells ( XREF_FIG ) although only a marginal effect was seen for miR20a in A549 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). To assess the function of miR20a on the expression of NKG2D ligands, A549 cells were transfected with control or miR20a mimic then treated with Gemcitabine. The transfection efficacy of control miR or miR20a mimic were evaluated by flow cytometry ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The miR20a mimic downregulated MICA expression and blocked Gemcitabine-induced MICA, while miR20a mimic has no effect on Gemcitabine-induced ULBP-2/5/6 in A549 cells ( XREF_FIG ). On the other hand, PC-9 cells were pretreated with miR20a inhibitor then exposed with Gefitinib. Transfection of miR20a inhibitor was confirmed by flow cytometry ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) and the miR20a inhibitor clearly upregulated the expression of MICB and blocked Gefitinib-induced inhibition of MICB expression, while miR20a inhibitor did not affect ULBP-2/5/6 expression in PC-9 cells ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that both ATM-ATR and EGFR pathway regulated MICA/B expression via miR20a, while ULBP-2/5/6 expression might be regulated by other miRs.\n\n\n\nGemcitabine-induced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is NKG2D-dependent while Gefitinib attenuated NK killing.\n\nNKG2D ligands are engaged by the NKG2D receptor expressed on NK cells and CD8+ T cells [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Since Gemcitabine enhanced the expression of NKG2D ligands in NSCLC cells, we evaluated if Gemcitabine would affect their sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Tumor cells were treated with 10 nM of Gemcitabine for 24 hours and thereafter their sensitivities to NK cell cytotoxicity and degranulation activity were evaluated using IL-2 activated NK cells. As expected, Gemcitabine treatment enhanced NK cell-mediated killing in A549 cells. To verify that this receptor is involved in the Gemcitabine-induced sensitivity to NK cell killing, purified NK cells were pretreated with anti-NKG2D blocking antibody before the LDH release assay or NK cell degranulation assay. The anti-NKG2D blocking antibody inhibited Gemcitabine-induced NK cell-mediated lysis as well as CD107a expression in NK cells against the A549 tumor target, while treatment with an isotype control antibody had no effect ( XREF_FIG ), indicating that the Gemcitabine-induced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was dependent on NKG2D-NKG2D ligand interaction. In spite of the enhancement of MHC class I molecules in A549 cells treatment with Gemcitabine, this treatment enhanced NK killing on tested target cells. This argues for a direct causal relationship between the up-regulation of NKG2D ligand expression by Gemcitabine and the increase in tumor NK sensitivity.\n\nNext, we evaluated if Gefitinib would affect their sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, since Gefitinib downregulated the expression of NKG2D ligands in PC-9 cells. PC-9 cells were treated with 1 muM of Gefitinib for 24 hours and thereafter their sensitivities to NK cell cytotoxicity and degranulation activity were evaluated using NK cells. As expected, Gefitinib attenuated NK cell-mediated killing and NK cell degranulation activity in PC-9 cells ( XREF_FIG ). Hence, the regulation mechanisms of the expression of NKG2D ligands, which influence NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, are schematically summarized in  XREF_FIG .\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn the present study, we report several findings supporting the induction mechanisms of the NKG2D ligand as well as important roles for regulating NKG2D ligand expression in NSCLC cell lines. Our observations suggest that cytotoxic anticancer drugs can induce the expression of NKG2D ligands. This is in line with the report by Morisaki and coworkers, who reported that Gemcitabine enhances the expression of MICA/B in the hepatocellular carcinoma line HepG2, but the molecular mechanisms of the Gemcitabine-induced MICA/B expression was not analyzed [ XREF_BIBR ]. The regulation of NKG2D ligand expression by Gemcitabine or other cytotoxic drugs has not previously been investigated in NSCLC cells. Therefore this study evaluated whether Gemcitabine enhances NKG2D ligand regulation and determines their impact on NK cell-mediated killing of NSCLC cell lines.\n\nIt is reported that the expression of NKG2D ligands is regulated by DNA stress-induced ATM-ATR signaling [ XREF_BIBR ], while other groups including us reported that oncogenes BCL/ABL and HER3 also regulated the expression of NKG2D ligands in transformed cells via mainly PI3K-AKT pathway [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. The ATM-ATR pathway, which plays a key role in the DNA damage response pathway, is frequently activated in tumor cells and was found to regulate NKG2D ligand via transcriptional regulation [ XREF_BIBR ]. We demonstrated that Gemcitabine activated ATM-ATR signalling, and specific ATM-ATR inhibitor KU55933 blocked Gemcitabine-induced activation of this pathway in A549, in line with a role also for this pathway in maintaining Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligands expression. We also assessed that silencing ATM gene could block Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligand expression. These findings indicated that Gemcitabine enhanced NKG2D ligands through genotoxic stress induced ATM-ATR signaling, while basal expression of NKG2D ligands might be maintained via other mechanisms including EGFR/ PI3K/AKT in NSCLC cells.\n\nInterestingly, cytotoxic anticancer drugs enhanced several NKG2D ligands while EGFR-TKI Gefitinib down-regulated the expression of NKG2D ligands in NSCLC cell lines. Therefore, a key issue is to determine whether EGFR signaling regulates the expression of NKG2D ligands. Our findings suggested that NKG2D ligand expression is regulated by not only DNA stress-induced ATM-ATR pathway but other signalling such as EGFR in NSCLC cells.\n\nIt has been previously reported that several miRNA suppress the expression of NKG2D ligands [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. We assessed the miRNA expression in NSCLC cells treated with Gemcitabine or Gefitinib. Both substances exert a dissimilar activity on miRNA expression, Gemcitabine, but not Gefitinib decreased both miR10b and miR20a, which were reported as suppressors for expressing NKG2D ligands [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ] suggesting that DNA stress may induce NKG2D ligand expression via downregulation of miR10b and miR20a. On the other hand, Gefitinib clearly increased miR20a in PC-9 and marginally increased in A549 cells. Thus, miR20a might be a common regulator for regulating NKG2D ligands. Our functional assay targeting miR20a showed both ATM-ATR and EGFR pathway regulated MICA/B expression via miR20a, although miR20a did not affect ULBP-2/5/6 expression suggesting that ULBP-2/5/6 might be regulated via other miRs.\n\nA critical question was determining the functional consequences of Gemcitabine-induced NKG2D ligand expression on tumor target cells. As anticipated, activation of ATM-ATR signalling by Gemcitabine enhanced sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in A549 cells. This finding implicated a role for the NKG2D-NKG2D ligand interaction in the modulation of the NK cell sensitivity to A549 cells. This premise was further bolstered by the observation that Gemcitabine-induced increase in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity could be blocked with an anti-NKG2D blocking antibody.\n\nNKG2D ligands induced by chemotherapeutic reagents such as Gemcitabine could represent one important mechanism, which the tumor cells are eradicated by the innate immune system [ XREF_BIBR ]. Our findings support the conclusion that Gemcitabine enhances NSCLC cells sensitivity for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Conversely, the implication from our results is that EGFR-TKI may suppress tumor sensitivity to NK cells via down-regulation of the expression of NKG2D ligands, as was shown by the attenuation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by Gefitinib.\n\nIn theory, our in vitro findings suggest that combination regimens with drugs that increase immune-mediated killing together with potent tumoricidal chemotherapy agents may be the optimum approach treating NSCLC. It has been reported that NK cell activity is quite low in patients with poor performance status or advanced disease [ XREF_BIBR ]. The cytotoxic drug-induced NKG2D ligands may help the clearance of tumor cells, but is potentially limited to the patients without NK cell dysfunction. In contrast, Gefitinib attenuates the sensitivity to NK cells, suggesting that therapy targeting EGFR-TKI may be a \"double-edged sword\" as they inhibit cell proliferation while abetting immune escape from host immunity in NSCLC cells. Regardless, enhancement of NK cell function by NK cell transfer or cytokine administration may be promising strategies to enhance NK killing via cytotoxic drug-induced NKG2D ligands or to overcome the limitation of EGFR-TKI targeting therapy.\n\n",
