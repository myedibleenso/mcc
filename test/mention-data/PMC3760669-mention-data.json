      "text":"Control of Angiogenesis by AIBP-mediated Cholesterol Efflux.\n\n\n\nCholesterol is a structural component of the cell, indispensable for normal cellular function, but its excess often leads to abnormal proliferation, migration, inflammatory responses and/or cell death. To prevent cholesterol overload, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate cholesterol efflux from the cells to apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and to the ApoA-I-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Maintaining efficient cholesterol efflux is essential for normal cellular function XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . However, the role of cholesterol efflux in angiogenesis and the identity of its local regulators are poorly understood. Here we show that ApoA-I binding protein (AIBP) accelerates cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells (EC) to HDL and thereby regulates angiogenesis. AIBP/HDL-mediated cholesterol depletion reduces lipid rafts, interferes with VEGFR2 dimerization and signaling, and inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and mouse aortic neovascularization ex vivo. Remarkably, Aibp regulates the membrane lipid order in embryonic zebrafish vasculature and functions as a non-cell autonomous regulator of zebrafish angiogenesis. Aibp knockdown results in dysregulated sprouting/branching angiogenesis, while forced Aibp expression inhibits angiogenesis. Dysregulated angiogenesis is phenocopied in Abca1/Abcg1-deficient embryos, and cholesterol levels are increased in Aibp-deficient and Abca1/Abcg1-deficient embryos. Our findings demonstrate that secreted AIBP positively regulates cholesterol efflux from EC and that effective cholesterol efflux is critical for proper angiogenesis.\n\n\n\nAIBP is a secreted protein discovered in a screen of proteins that physically associate with ApoA-I 7 . Human APOA1BP mRNA encoding the AIBP protein is ubiquitously expressed 7 . Although the AIBP binding to ApoA-I implies that AIBP may modulate HDL function XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , its role in cholesterol efflux has not been experimentally tested.\n\nFirst, we investigated whether human AIBP (hAIBP) had any effect on cholesterol removal from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in which ABCG1 is a major transporter responsible for cholesterol efflux to HDL XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR . In the presence of hAIBP, cholesterol efflux from HUVEC to HDL 3  was increased 2-fold, and the ABCG1 deficiency completely abrogated this effect ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). hAIBP did not promote cholesterol efflux in absence of HDL 3  ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), but the hAIBP binding to HUVEC ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) increased the overall HUVEC capacity to bind HDL 3  (B max =1.5 vs. 0.8) and the constant of HDL 3  dissociation from HUVEC (K d =1.0x10 -6 M vs. 0.33x10 -6 M;  XREF_FIG ), thereby creating conditions that would facilitate HDL 3 -mediated cholesterol efflux.\n\nTo investigate the role of AIBP/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in angiogenesis, we incubated HUVEC with hAIBP and/or HDL 3  and then stimulated cells with VEGF. hAIBP and HDL 3  added separately did not affect EC tube formation, but together they significantly reduced angiogenesis ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) 11  also inhibited angiogenesis, whereas cholesterol-loaded MbetaCD, which delivers cholesterol to the cell, promoted angiogenesis ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). If the hAIBP/HDL 3  inhibition of angiogenesis is the consequence of accelerated cholesterol efflux, then this effect should depend on the presence of the cholesterol transporter ABCG1. Indeed, knockdown of ABCG1 in HUVEC rescued VEGF-induced angiogenesis from the hAIBP/HDL 3  inhibition ( XREF_FIG ). Further, we tested both hAIBP and zAibp2 (a zebrafish protein, which will be discussed later) in an ex vivo aortic ring angiogenesis assay. A cluster of HEK293 cells producing either hAIBP, zAibp2 or mCherry (negative control) was placed 0.5 mm from the edge of a mouse aortic ring, and VEGF was added to stimulate angiogenesis. Both hAIBP and zAibp2, but not mCherry, significantly reduced neovascularization of aortic rings isolated from a wild type mouse ( XREF_FIG ). Aortic rings from an Abcg1 -/-  mouse responded to VEGF with a more vigorous angiogenesis, which was not significantly reduced by hAIBP or zAibp2. These results support the hypothesis that cholesterol efflux is necessary for the AIBP-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis.\n\nHDL-mediated depletion of cholesterol from plasma membrane disrupts cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-rich membrane microdomains XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , often designated as lipid rafts, and affects membrane receptor signaling 11 . We found that hAIBP/HDL 3  reduced the lipid raft content in HUVEC and disrupted cell-surface colocalization of caveolin-1 and VEGFR2 ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The hAIBP/HDL 3  treatment, similarly to the treatment with MbetaCD, decreased VEGFR2 and caveolin-1 localization to the lipid raft fraction isolated from cell lysates ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Many studies suggest that VEGFR2 localization to lipid rafts facilitates VEGFR2 dimerization and endocytosis XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , the steps required for VEGF-mediated signaling 18 . In our experiments, the hAIBP/HDL 3  treatment reduced VEGF-induced VEGFR2 dimerization and endocytosis as well as phosphorylation of VEGFR2, Akt, FAK, Src and to a lesser degree of ERK1/2 ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Importantly, subsequent addition of cholesterol partially reversed inhibition of VEGFR2, FAK and Akt phosphorylation in hAIBP/HDL 3 -treated cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Consistent with the effect on VEGF signaling, HUVEC migration toward a VEGF cue was significantly reduced in hAIBP/HDL 3 -treated cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest that hAIBP facilitates cholesterol efflux from HUVEC to HDL and that cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane disrupts lipid rafts and VEGF signaling and inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis.\n\nAIBP is evolutionary conserved from Drosophila to zebrafish to mouse and human ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Zebrafish have two genes, apoa1bp1 and apoa1bp2, encoding zAibp1 and zAibp2 proteins, respectively ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The zaibp2 expression in 24-36 hours postfertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos shows a clear segmental pattern, colocalizing with the somite marker myod ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). By 48 hpf, when segmental angiogenesis is completed, zaibp2 is no longer expressed in somites.\n\nBoth zAibp2 and zAibp1 bound to human ApoA-I and to the HDL in human plasma, but only zAibp2 was effective in promoting cholesterol efflux from HUVEC to HDL 3  ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Zebrafish embryos injected with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) targeting zaibp2 translation sites had increased levels of free (unesterified) cholesterol, whereas injections of zaibp1 or scrambled control MO did not result in any changes ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Thus, we focused on zaibp2. Using the polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe Laurdan, we observed a higher membrane lipid order in the areas of growing segmental arteries (SeA) corresponding to tip cells compared to stalk cells ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting a higher content of lipid rafts in tip cells, which may positively regulate Vegfr2 signaling. The membrane lipid order was increased in the SeA of zaibp2 morphants compared to controls, and the difference between tip and stalk cells was lost. To test the hypothesis that zAibp2-mediated cholesterol efflux regulates membrane order in growing SeA, we injected zaibp2 morphants with human HDL 3  or with BSA. Adding an excess of HDL 3  - to promote cholesterol efflux and to override the zAibp2 deficiency - annulled the increase in membrane order in SeA of zaibp2 morphants, and a spatially indiscriminate HDL 3  excess equalized the membrane order in tip and stalk cells. Adding an excess of BSA had no effect on the membrane order in zaibp2 morphants. Lysates of zaibp2 knockdown embryos displayed increased phosphorylation of Vegfr2, Akt and Src, and decreased phosphorylation of Erk1 ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest that zAibp2 regulates cholesterol levels, the membrane lipid order, and Vegfr2 signaling and, thus, may control angiogenesis.\n\nIndeed, injection of MOs targeting zaibp2 translation or splicing sites into one-cell stage embryos of Tg(fli1:egfp) y1  zebrafish, which express EGFP in EC 19 , resulted in remarkable dysregulation of angiogenesis, with profound ectopic branching of both SeA and subintestinal veins (SIV) ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The zaibp2 knockdown was validated in western blot ( XREF_FIG ). The ectopic branching of SeAs in zaibp2 morphants was partially rescued by forced expression of zaibp2 mRNA lacking the MO target site ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nThe zaibp2 expression pattern ( XREF_FIG ) resembles that of type 3 semaphorins, non-cell autonomous repellent cues that guide the patterning of developing SeAs via endothelial-specific PlexinD1 receptors 20 . To determine the cell autonomy of the zAibp2 effect on angiogenesis, we performed cell transplantation experiments, using Tg(fli1:egfp) y1  donors. Fluorescent EC from wild type donors found in non-fluorescent zaibp2 morphants displayed excessive branching and filopodial projections, while fluorescent EC from zaibp2 morphant donors found in wild type recipients had normal morphology ( XREF_FIG ). In a gain-of-function experiment, overexpression of zAibp2 inhibited SeA sprouting from the dorsal aorta and normal growth of sprouted SeA ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest a role for zAibp2 as a repellent molecule whose function depends on the milieu surrounding EC but not on zAibp2 expression in the EC themselves.\n\nThe loss of zAibp2 resulted in increased expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, such as tie2, vegfr2, vegfr3 and fli1 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Thus, in addition to the zAibp2 effect on the membrane lipid order and Vegfr2 signaling ( XREF_FIG ), zAibp2 affects expression of angiogenic genes as well.\n\nTo further validate that effective cholesterol efflux is required for normal angiogenesis, we knocked down zebrafish cholesterol transporters abca1 and abcg1 XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  and observed higher levels of free cholesterol, increased levels of phosphorylated Akt, Vegfr2 and Src and dysregulated SeA and SIV angiogenesis ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), closely reproducing the angiogenesis defects of zaibp2 morphants. Individual knockdown of each abca1 and abcg1 suggested a dominant role of abca1 in embryonic angiogenesis ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In contrast to the zaibp2 non-cell autonomous regulation of angiogenesis, fluorescent EC from abca1/abcg1 morphant donors found in wild type recipients displayed excessive SeA branching ( XREF_FIG ), confirming that cholesterol efflux from EC is required to restrain ectopic angiogenesis. Overexpression of zAibp2-mCherry in somites resulted in inhibition of SeA growth, which was rescued by knocking down abca1/abcg1 ( XREF_FIG ). These results provide additional evidence that expression of zAibp2 limits blood vessel growth and also suggest that zebrafish Abca1- and/or Abcg1-mediated cholesterol efflux is required for the zAibp2 effect on angiogenesis.\n\nBased on our results, we propose that there is an additional level of paracrine regulation of the VEGFR2 pathway in which cholesterol efflux and associated reduction of ordered membrane microdomains/lipid rafts interfere with the VEGFR2 membrane localization, dimerization, endocytosis, and signaling. Because in 24 hpf zebrafish zaibp2 mRNA is highly expressed in somites, but not in the inter-somitic spaces where SeA grow, it is likely that zAibp2-mediated cholesterol efflux inhibits Vegfr2 signaling in a site-specific manner to prevent lateral protrusions from stalk and tip cells and restrains ectopic SeA growth into somites ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nThe role of cholesterol efflux mechanisms in protecting against endothelial dysfunction, in particular in hypercholesterolemic animals prone to development of atherosclerosis, has been reported XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR . However, our study is the first to demonstrate the role of AIBP in promoting cholesterol efflux from EC to HDL and the importance of this mechanism in regulation of angiogenesis. In contrast to the ApoA-I-containing HDL, ApoB-containing LDL and VLDL deliver cholesterol and other lipids to the cell and, thus, are positioned to promote angiogenesis. Interestingly, a recent paper finds the opposite, that ApoB lipoproteins negatively regulate angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos 24 . The authors suggest a mechanism in which the ApoB protein, but not the lipid components within ApoB-containing lipoproteins, is responsible for transcriptional regulation of Vegfr1, a soluble decoy receptor for Vegf. Our experiments uncovered a different, lipid-mediated mechanism in which effective cholesterol efflux is a critical process that ensures proper angiogenesis and Aibp secreted by the surrounding tissues serves as an important negative regulator of angiogenesis.\n\n\n\nFull Methods.\n\n\n\nCloning of human and zebrafish AIBP, recombinant protein expression and purification, and antibody production.\n\nZebrafish aibp2 (Ggene ID:557840) and aibp1 (Gene ID:436891) were cloned from zebrafish brain cDNA using primers: CCGGAATTCCATGTTGGGGGTTCGAGCTCTG (5') and CGCGGATCCTCAGTTGAGCTGAAACACACACTC (3') for zaibp1; and CCGGAATTCCGCCACCATGAACCACAGCTCCAACG (5') and CGCGGATCCCGCAGTTCTATAATACATTCTGTGC (3') for zaibp2. The fragments were cloned in frame into pFLAG-CMV4 (Sigma). Human APOA1BP (Gene ID: 128240) was cloned from HEK293 cell cDNA using primers: CCGGAATTCCATGTCCAGGCTGCGGGCGCTGCTGGGCCTCG (5') and CGGGGTACCTCACTGCAGACGATAGACACACTC (3'). For expression of AIBP proteins, the genes were cloned in frame into pHUE vector 26  (kindly provided by Tracy Handel), expressed in BL21 DE3 competent cells (Invitrogen) and purified with a Ni-NTA agarose resin column (Qiagen). Deubiquitinase (DUB) expressed in pHUE was used as a negative control in experiments with recombinant AIBP. To produce a zAibp2 antibody, recombinant zAibp2 was mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) and injected subcutaneously into a guinea pig. The guinea pig was boosted 3 more times. Post-immune plasma was compared with pre-immune plasma from the same animal and used in western blot to detect zAibp2 in zebrafish lysates ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by adding excess of recombinant zAibp2 to the antibody, which prevented its binding to a specific band on the western blot.\n\n\n\nCholesterol efflux.\n\nA cholesterol efflux assay was performed as described XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , with modifications. In brief, HUVEC (ATCC) were loaded with 2 muCi/ml  3 H-cholesterol, and cholesterol efflux was initiated by the addition of 0.2% BSA/EBM with 50 mug/ml HDL 3  (isolated from normolipidemic human plasma by ultracentrifugation), in the presence or absence of 0.2 mug/ml zAibp2, zAibp1, or hAIBP. DUB, replacing AIBP, was used as a negative control. Background, non-specific release of  3 H-cholesterol was measured in absence of HDL or any other protein. After 1 to 6 hours of incubation, the medium was collected and counted in a liquid scintillation counter LS 6500 (Beckman Coulter). The cells were extracted with 2-propanol, and the lipid extract was added to ScintiVerse BD Cocktail (Fisher) and counted. Cholesterol efflux was expressed as a percentage of  3 H counts in the medium compared to combined  3 H counts in the cells and the medium. Background, non-specific release of  3 H from the cells was subtracted.\n\n\n\nABCG1 knockdown.\n\nBoth negative control and ABCG1 siRNA oligonucleotides were from Ambion. HUVEC were plated in 6-well plates at 5x10 5  cells/well and transfected with 66.6 nM siRNA using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, cells were washed and used in an efflux assay. Two additional wells of transfected cells were used to confirm ABCG1 knockdown in western blot using an antibody from Novus Biologicals.\n\n\n\nAIBP/HDL 3  - HUVEC binding assay.\n\nhAIBP and HDL 3  were biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) according the manufacture's protocol. Binding of biotinylated hAIBP or biotinylated HDL 3  to HUVEC was assessed by a chemiluminescent binding assay as described by Fang et al. 28 , with modifications. HUVEC (2x10 4 ) were seeded into 96-well flat bottom plates in 5% FBS-EBM. After 72 h, plates were blocked with ice-cold 1% BSA-PBS for 30 min on ice, incubated with ice-cold biotinylated proteins for 2 h on ice, washed, and fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 30 min. HUVEC-bound biotinylated hAIBP or HDL 3  were detected with NeutrAvidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) and LumiPhos 530 (Lumigen, Southfield, MI), using a Dynex luminometer (Dynex Technologies). Data were recorded as relative light units counted per 100 ms. All samples were assayed in triplicates. The parameters of hAIBP and HDL 3  binding to HUVEC (B max  and K d ) were calculated using a total and non-specific binding algorithm within the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software package. The following model was used: H + C <--> HC, where H is unbound HDL 3 , C is cells, and HC is HDL 3  bound to the cells. The equations used for calculating binding parameters were:\n\n[HC]specific=Bmaxx[H]/([H]+Kd)[HC]nonspecific=a+bx[H][HC]total=[HC]specific+[HC]nonspecific,where a is background and b is the slope of the linear fit of nonspecific binding. Goodness of fit of non-linear regression was estimated using R 2  and standard deviation of residuals (Sy.x), expressed in the same units as [H] and B max . A molecular mass of 80 kDa was used for the HDL protein.\n\n\n\nIn vitro angiogenesis assay.\n\nThe angiogenesis assay was carried out as described in reference 29 . Growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was thawed at 4degreesC overnight and diluted with an equal volume of serum-free EBM medium (Lonza). Each well of 96-well plates was coated with 50 mul diluted Matrigel and incubated at 37degreesC for 1 hour. HUVEC were serum-starved and then pre-incubated with HLD 3  and/or hAIBP. Cells were harvested and added to Matrigel-coated plates at 1x10 4  cells per well in EBM, in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml VEGF (R&D Systems). Following a 12 hour incubation, tubular structures were imaged with a phase contrast microscope.\n\n\n\nFree cholesterol measurements in HUVEC.\n\nHUVEC cholesterol levels were measured in cellular lipid extracts using a colorimetric assay (BioVision) as described 14 .\n\n\n\nAortic ring neovascularization assay.\n\nThe method was adopted from reference 30 , with modifications. Thoracic aorta was isolated from a 6-week old male C57BL6 mouse or an age and gender matched Abcg1 -/-  mouse (kindly provided by Catherine Hedrick, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology), cleaned from surrounding fat and connective tissue and sliced into 1 mm long rings. The aortic rings were placed in wells of a 48-well plate containing solidified Matrigel and then covered with additional Matrigel. Small wells were made in Matrigel approximately 0.5 mm from aortic rings and 50 mul aliquots of Matrigel containing 1x10 5  HEK293 cells transfected with mCherry (negative control), zAIBP2 or hAIBP were placed in these wells. After 10 min, each well was filled with EBM medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml VEGF and the plates were incubated at 37degreesC for 6 days. Media were changed every two days. The rings were photographed in phase contrast using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope.\n\n\n\nVisualization of lipid rafts with cholera toxin B.\n\nHUVEC were plated on glass coverslips and preincubated with 50 mug/ml HDL 3 , 0.1 mug/ml hAIBP, or 50 mug/ml HDL 3  + 0.1 mug/ml hAIBP for 4 hours. Cells were washed once with medium before the addition of 1 mug/ml Alexa Fluor 594-labeled cholera toxin B (CTB, from Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 15 min at 4degreesC, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 15 min at 4degreesC with an anti-CTB antibody (EMD Chemicals) to crosslink CTB and lipid rafts. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at 4degreesC, mounted with a Prolong Antifade Kit with DAPI (Invitrogen) and images were captured with a Leica DM IRE2 fluorescent microscope.\n\n\n\nCell fractionation.\n\nLipid rafts (light membrane fractions) were isolated using a detergent-free, discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation method 14 . Briefly, HUVEC were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and cells were scraped from the plate in 0.5 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11.0) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), homogenized and sonicated 3 x 10 sec. Samples were adjusted to 45% sucrose by adding a 90% sucrose solution in MBS (25 mM Mes, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 6.5) and placed into ultracentrifugation tubes. A 5-35% sucrose discontinuous gradient was formed above the sample, followed by ultracentrifugation at 35x10 3  rpm for 18 hours at 4degreesC in a SW-41 rotor (Beckman). Ten 1 ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of each gradient. The lipid rafts fraction (fraction 5) and the non-lipid rafts fraction (fraction 10) were used for further analysis, which included measurements of protein concentration and immunoblotting. Thirty mul of lipid rafts and non-lipid rafts fractions (adjusted to load equal protein concentrations of each sample) were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and blotted with the indicated antibodies.\n\n\n\nCaveolin-1 and VEGFR2 colocalization.\n\nHUVEC plated on chamber coverglass (Lab-Tek(TM) II) were incubated for 4 hours with 0.1 mug/ml hAIBP, 50 mug/ml HDL 3  or 0.1 mug/ml hAIBP + 50 mug/ml HDL 3,  and the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with warm 4% PFA for 15min at room temperature. HUVEC were permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with anti-Caveolin-1 (BD Biosciences) and anti-VEGFR2 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 antibodies. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescent microscope operating in TIRF mode. Raw TIFF images of Caveolin-1 and VEGFR2 were analyzed using JACoP algorithm 31  in Image J. Colocalization was quantified using Pearson's coefficient.\n\n\n\nVEGFR2 endocytosis.\n\nHUVEC were incubated for 4 hours with 0.1 mug/ml hAIBP, 50 mug/ml HDL 3  or 0.1 mug/ml hAIBP + 50 mug/ml HDL 3 , followed by a 20 min incubation with 50 ng/ml VEGF. Cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against VEGFR2 and the early endosomal marker EEA-1-FITC (BD Biosciences). Images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescent microscope. VEGFR2 and EEA-1 colocalization was quantified using Pearson's coefficient with the JACoP plugin loaded to ImageJ 31 .\n\n\n\nVEGFR2 dimerization assay.\n\nThe assay was carried out as described in reference 32 . Two days after plating 1 x 10 6  HUVEC in a 10 cm dish, the cells were starved overnight in 0.5% FBS-EBM. Next day, cells were incubated with hAIBP and/or HDL 3 , followed by a 20 min incubation with 50 ng/ml VEGF and then crosslinked with 1 mg/ml bis-sulfosuccinimidyl (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-VEGFR2 antibody immobilized on agarose beads. The beads were washed and the eluted samples were run on SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the VEGFR2 antibody.\n\n\n\nHUVEC migration assay.\n\nSerum starved HUVEC were pretreated with 50 mug/ml HDL 3 , 0.2 mug/ml hAIBP, or 50 mug/ml HDL 3  + 0.2 mug/ml hAIBP for 4 hours at 37degreesC in 5% LPDS/EBM, harvested from the plate, washed, resuspended in 5% LPDS/EBM and added to the transwell (8 mum pore size). VEGF was added to the lower chamber at 20 ng/ml. Following a 4 hour incubation, the transwell membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min and stained with filtered 0.5% Crystal Violet for 10 min, and transmigrated cells were counted.\n\n\n\nZebrafish.\n\nWild type AB and transgenic Tg(fli1:egfp) y1  and Tg(flk1:ras-cherry) s896  zebrafish lines XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR  were kindly provided by Dr. David Traver and Neil Chi (UCSD). Zebrafish were maintained as previously described 34 , and all experimental procedures were approved by the UCSD IACUC.\n\n\n\nConfocal microscopy.\n\nConfocal imaging was carried out as previously described 35 . Briefly, anaesthetized zebrafish embryos (treated at 24 hpf with 0.003% PTU) were housed in a sealed chamber (Invitrogen) in a small drop of 0.02% tricaine (Sigma) containing E3 medium and imaged using a Nikon C1-si confocal microscope. Z-stacks were acquired with a 1-3 mum step, and images were 3D rendered and analyzed using Imaris(R) software (Bitplane). All 3D reconstructions were performed with the same threshold settings.\n\n\n\nMorpholino oligonucleotide injections.\n\nTo knock down gene expression, 4-8 ng of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO; synthesized by GeneTools) were injected into one-cell stage embryos. A control MO was derived from the zaibp2 sequence, with 5 mismatched oligonucleotides.\n\nControl MO: TGAGCTTCATGTTCATTTATTCCGC; zaibp2 MO (zaibp2 MO1): TGTGGTTCATCTTGATTTATTCGGC; zaibp2 splicing MO (zaibp2 MO2):TGTTGAGTGTCAGACAAACCTTGGT zaibp1 MO: TCTGTATTCAAATCAGACGCTCAGT; abca1 MO: AACCCAACTGAGTGGAGACAGCCAT; abcg1 MO: AAAAGGCTGCCATGAGACATGCCAT.\n\n\n\nQuantitative analysis of cell sprouts in segmental arteries (SeA) and subintestinal veins (SIV).\n\nTo determine changes in segmental artery cell sprouts in embryos injected with MO targeting zaibp2, zaibp1, abca1 and/or abcg1, we counted abnormal projections in 4 to 6 pairs of segmental arteries in adjacent somite boundaries in each zebrafish. For each set of injections, 15 embryos (i.e. 60-90 sprouts) were examined. Values were expressed as a number of ectopic sprouts per SeA. To examine sprouts in SIV, only the sprouts moving in the ventral direction out of the SIV were counted. Values were expressed as a number of ventral SIV sprouts per zebrafish.\n\n\n\nMeasuring membrane lipid order with polarity-sensitive probe.\n\nThe experiments were carried out as described in references XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR . Briefly, live Tg(flk1:ras-cherry) s896  zebrafish embryos were incubated with 5 muM Laurdan (Invitrogen) at 28degreesC for 30 min. The concentration of a Laurdan stock solution was measured using OD at 365 nm and an extinction coefficient of 19000 cm -1 M -1 . After incubation with Laurdan, embryos were incubated with E3 medium for additional 30 min, fixed in PFA for 4 hours at room temperature, deyolked, and embedded in 1% low melting temperature agarose for imaging. Images were captured with a Leica SP5 confocal/multiphoton system, using a water immersion 20x objective. The confocal mode was used to capture mCherry fluorescence and the multiphoton mode was used to capture Laurdan images (ex 800 nm, em 400-460 nm and 470-530 nm) in the same embryos. The multiphoton results were displayed as pseudocolored GP (a measure of the membrane lipid order) images, derived from Laurdan ratiometric measurements and using a ImageJ plug-in as described 36 . The quantitative data were obtained by measuring GP values in the areas corresponding to tip cells (top 1/3 of the SeA length), stalk cells (bottom 2/3 of the SeA length) and the dorsal aorta in several individual, mCherry-masked z-sections. This method ensured that GP values were derived only from EC (e.g. from the areas where mCherry was in focus in each z-section). The GP images in  XREF_FIG  were composed each from four to five individual z-sections, with a minimal overlap of mCherry-masked GP images.\n\n\n\nWhole mount in situ hybridization.\n\nWISH was carried out as described XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Briefly, wild type embryos or morphants at indicated developmental stages were fixed with 4% PFA and the embryos older than 24 hpf were permeabilized with 10 mug/ml proteinase K (Roche). Subsequently, the embryos were pre-hybridized at 70degreesC for 4-6 hours, and then hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled zaibp2 antisense probe at 65degreesC for 2 days. Both the control sense and anti-sense RNA probes were directly synthesized from zaibp2 full length gene using a Roche T7/SP6 RNA or Ambion T3 RNA synthesis kit. After extensive wash, hybridized RNA was detected by immunohistochemistry using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody against digoxigenin (Roche) and a chromogenic substrate nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) 38  (Sigma). A similar procedure was performed with tie2, vegfr2, vegfr3, fli1 and cdh5 probes. Double WISH was performed as described 41 . Both digoxigenin-labeled zaibp2 and fluorescein-labeled myod were hybridized with the same embryos. The embryos were then first incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-fluorescein Ab, and fast red (Roche) was used as a substrate. Subsequently, the embryos were washed, fixed with 4% PFA and incubated with anti-digoxigenin Ab conjugated alkaline phosphatase, and then NBT/BCIP was used as a chromogenic substrate.\n\n\n\nTransplantation experiments.\n\nCell transplantation was performed as described 39 , with different combinations of donors and recipients as indicated in  XREF_FIG . Donor embryos were of the Tg(fli1:egfp) y1  origin, and recipient embryos were of the wild type origin. At the one-cell stage, donor Tg(fli1:egfp) y1  embryos were injected with rhodamine-labeled dextran (Mini-Ruby, Invitrogen) as a lineage tracer. At the sphere stage (approximately 4 hpf), embryos were dechorionated by 0.4 mg/ml pronase (Sigma) and transferred to agarose wells (Adaptive Science Tools, Worcester, MA). Approximately 20-40 cells from the margin of a donor embryo were transferred to the margin of a recipient embryo. The recipient embryos were subsequently grown at 28degreesC and imaged at 72 hpf. Endothelial cells in chimeric zebrafish originating from donor embryos were visualized by their green fluorescence using a Leica M165FC fluorescent stereoscope. For detailed analysis, images were captured using a Nikon C1-si confocal microscope. Numbers of ectopic branches in each fluorescent SeA were counted.\n\n\n\nReal time PCR.\n\nReal time PCR was performed using a Rotor Gene Q qPCR machine (Qiagen). Real time PCR master mix Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix was from Invitrogen. The primers were synthesized by IDT. The PCR program was: 50degreesC for 2 minutes (UDG incubation), 95degreesC for 2 minutes, 40 cycles of: 95degreesC for 15 seconds, 60degreesC for 1 minute. Primer sequences: fli1 (F): CTTGGCACGTTGCCTTGATAAG, fli1 (R): CCTTCATATCTGAGAGTGATCCC; tie2 (F): GCGATGGATGGCAATAGAGT, tie2 (R): CGACAGCAGGATCTGAGAGA; vegfr2 (F): TCCACGAGGGTGGGCAGTCA; vegfr2 (R): AGACGGGTGGTGTGGAGTAACGA. kdrb (F): TGCCCACATGGAGCTGCTAGCA; kdrb (R): TGTGGCACATTCAACCACATGAGC. beta-actin (F): CTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCT, beta-actin (R): GGTTGGTTCGTTCGTTTGAAT.\n\n\n\nImmunoblot of zebrafish lysates.\n\nZebrafish were lysed on ice with a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mM sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X 100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and a protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma). Protein content was determined with a DC protein assay kit (BioRad) and equal protein amounts of the cell lysates were run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE with MOPS buffer (Invitrogen) and then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). The blots were probed with appropriate antibodies against specific phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins (Cell Signaling Technology), secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP and developed using a Super Signal West Dura substrate (Pierce).\n\n\n\nFilipin staining.\n\nFilipin staining of embryos was performed as described 42 . Zebrafish were fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4degreesC. The fixed fish were incubated overnight with 0.05% filipin (Sigma) in PBS with 1% sheep serum, and then washed 3 times with PBS. Images were captured immediately with a Leica M165FC fluorescent stereoscope and quantified.\n\n\n\nTotal lipid extraction and free cholesterol measurements in zebrafish.\n\nTotal lipid was extracted from zebrafish embryos as we previously described 28 . In brief, trunk/tail segments were dissected from fifty 24 hpf embryos and pooled together. The tissue was homogenized and supplemented with 50 mug stigmasterol, an internal standard to control for recovery of extracted sterols. Total lipid extraction was performed with 1:2 methanol/dichloromethane. No saponification of cholesterol esters was performed because the goal of this study was to measure free cholesterol, the form of cholesterol transferred from the cells via ABC transporters to ApoA-I/HDL. Cholesterol and stigmasterol were measured with a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph using a 30 m x 0.25 mm (i.d.) ZB-5HT inferno capillary column, film thickness 0.2 mum (Phenomenex). Cholesterol levels were normalized to protein and then to the levels in embryos injected with control MO.\n\n",
