      "text":"Crucial Role of TSC-22 in Preventing the Proteasomal Degradation of p53 in Cervical Cancer.\n\n\n\nThe p53 tumor suppressor function can be compromised in many tumors by the cellular antagonist HDM2 and human papillomavirus oncogene E6 that induce p53 degradation. Restoration of p53 activity has strong therapeutic potential. Here, we identified TSC-22 as a novel p53-interacting protein and show its novel function as a positive regulator of p53. We found that TSC-22 level was significantly down-regulated in cervical cancer tissues. Moreover, over-expression of TSC-22 was sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation, promote cellular apoptosis in cervical cancer cells and suppress growth of xenograft tumors in mice. Expression of also TSC-22 enhanced the protein level of p53 by protecting it from poly-ubiquitination. When bound to the motif between amino acids 100 and 200 of p53, TSC-22 inhibited the HDM2- and E6-mediated p53 poly-ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, ectopic over-expression of TSC-22 activated the function of p53, followed by increased expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1  and PUMA in human cervical cancer cell lines. Interestingly, TSC-22 did not affect the interaction between p53 and HDM2. Knock-down of TSC-22 by small interfering RNA clearly enhanced the poly-ubiquitination of p53, leading to the degradation of p53. These results suggest that TSC-22 acts as a tumor suppressor by safeguarding p53 from poly-ubiquitination mediated-degradation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nTGF-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) was first identified as a TGF-beta-inducible gene in mouse osteoblastic cells. TSC-22 expression is induced in a variety of cell lines by TGF-beta, phorbol ester, serum, and progestin and positively regulates the TGF-beta signaling  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . TSC-22 contains a leucine zipper-like motif, but it does not have a DNA-binding motif at the N-terminal region. TSC-22 can homodimerize and heterodimerize with TSC-22 homologous gene-1 (THG-1), and has transcriptional repressor activity  XREF_BIBR .\n\nSome researchers have identified the physiological roles of TSC-22 in the developmental process. TSC-22 is required for gastrulation during early embryogenesis in Xenopus laevis\n XREF_BIBR  and for oogenesis in Drosophila\n XREF_BIBR . It has been also suggested that TSC-22 induces erythroid cell and Cardiac myofibroblast differentiation via activating the transcriptional activity of Smad3 and Smad4, and antagonizing the Smad7 in response to TGF-beta-dependent signaling  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR .\n\nAdditionally, several studies have focused on the tumor suppression functions of TSC22. TSC22 is thought to be a potent tumor suppressor in salivary cancer cells  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  human gastric carcinoma cells  XREF_BIBR , hepatic carcinoma  XREF_BIBR , human astrocytic tumors  XREF_BIBR , and large granular lymphocyte leukemia  XREF_BIBR . The detailed mechanisms of the tumor suppressor function of TSC22 have been reported along with the hypothesis that TSC-22 represses the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes Gadd45b and Lzts2\n XREF_BIBR , negatively regulates Ras/Raf signaling  XREF_BIBR  and involved in the TGF-b-mediated gastric carcinoma cell death in a caspase3-dependent manner  XREF_BIBR . On the other hand, TSC22-mediated apoptotic activity is inhibited by the interaction between TSC-22 and fortillin, followed by leading to TSC-22 destabilization  XREF_BIBR .\n\np53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene that acts by activating the transcription of its targeted genes such as p21, PUMA, , PKR and BAX  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . p53 functions are regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. It is well-understood that p53 levels are tightly regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination via an auto-regulatory feedback loop  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Occasionally, the regulation of p53 expression is correlated with tumorigenesis through infection by human papilloma virus expressing E6, which leads to ubiquitin-mediated p53 degradation  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Even though the regulation of p53 has been examined via multiple routes related to tumorigenesis, many questions remain about the tumor inhibition mechanism of the p53 pathway.\n\nSince the mechanism underlying the network of tumor suppressor genes has not yet been explicitly elucidated, we conducted a cDNA microarray analysis of the gene expression profile in cancer tissue to find novel tumor-related genes. We found that TSC-22 expression was significantly decreased in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. Subsequently, we explored the novel function of TSC-22 during tumorigenesis. We therefore performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen for novel TSC-22-binding proteins. From this, p53 was identified as a TSC-22-binding protein. We also found that TSC-22 could enhance the activities of p53 through the inhibition of HDM2 and E6-mediated ubiquitination by directly binding to p53. On the other hand, TSC-22 over-expression stabilized p53 protein level, leading to increased cell death and inhibition of cell proliferation. Finally, tumor growth rate was strongly reduced by the expression of TSC-22 in a xenograft tumor model. Taken together, these results indicate that TSC-22 plays a crucial role in the inhibition of tumor growth through the regulation of p53 ubiquitination.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nTSC22 Inhibits Tumor Growth.\n\nIn order to analyze the specific gene expression profile of cervical cancer, we conducted cDNA microarray analysis with cDNA prepared from patients' cervical cancer tissues. Interestingly, our microarray data showed that TSC-22 gene expression was noticeably decreased in all cancer samples (data not shown). We then conducted real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis to confirm the microarray results. As shown in  XREF_FIG , TSC-22 mRNA expression levels in the patients' cancer tissues were significantly reduced compared to those in normal tissue.\n\nThese results led to further questions. The first question was whether TSC-22 could suppress tumor cell proliferation or not. Therefore, we infected HeLa (HPV-18) and Caski (HPV-16) cells with adenovirus expressing TSC-22 or LacZ (infection control). As shown in  XREF_FIG , the proliferation ratios of both cells were significantly reduced by infection with Ad-TSC-22. We next examined whether TSC-22 could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells. We found that the G0/G1 population was dramatically increased among Ad-TSC-22-infected cells compared to that in Ad-LacZ-infected cells within 48 h after infection. Furthermore, most Ad-TSC-22-infected cells underwent apoptosis in the late stage ( XREF_FIG ). We next assessed the chromosomal-DNA fragmentation to observe the TSC-22-induced apoptosis in HeLa and Caski cells. As shown in  XREF_FIG , chromosomal DNA from Ad-TSC-22-infected HeLa and Caski cells showed very high level of fragmentation. Besides, p21 (cell cycle inhibitor) and PUMA (apoptosis inducer) expression levels were markedly enhanced in Ad-TSC-22 infected HeLa and Caski cell ( XREF_FIG ). These effects were more significant in chronically HPV18-infected HeLa cell. p53 and TSC22 level in HeLa cells were barely detected compare(d) to caski cells ( XREF_FIG ). We speculate that their different expressions are caused by the different serotype of HPV. These results indicate that over-expression of TSC-22 induced high levels of cell death. Our results strongly suggest that TSC-22 plays a pivotal role in cervical tumor cell growth and death.\n\n\n\nTSC-22 Binds to p53 in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay.\n\nAs shown by our data, TSC-22 contributes to the inhibition of cancer cell growth and cell death. This was consistent with previous studies demonstrating that TSC-22 is a potential tumor suppressor  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this function, we screened for TSC-22-binding proteins using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Through this, p53 was identified as a TSC-22-binding protein ( XREF_FIG ). The interaction between TSC-22 and p53 was thus demonstrated in vitro by both cell growth and a beta-galactosidase assay ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nDetermination of the Effects of TSC-22 on p53.\n\nTo better understand the effects of TSC-22 on p53, HeLa and Caski cells were infected with Ad-TSC-22 or LacZ for increasing periods of time. Interestingly, endogenous p53 levels were significantly increased by transfection of Ad-TSC-22 in a time-dependent fashion ( XREF_FIG ). The enhancement of p53 expression was more significant in HeLa cells than in Caski cells. In order to observe the enhancement of p53 target gene activity by the expression of TSC22, Flag-tagged TSC-22 was introduced into HeLa cells. p53 protein and its target genes, including p21 and puma, were clearly induced by Flag-TSC-22 expression ( XREF_FIG ). Conversely, knocking-down TSC-22 in HeLa cells reduced the protein levels of p53 and PUMA ( XREF_FIG ). However, the level of p53 mRNA was not affected by knock-down and over-expression of TSC-22 ( XREF_FIG , bottom panel).\n\nTo determine whether p53 activity is regulated by TSC-22 expression in HeLa cells, we assessed the p53RE (responsible element)-driven promoter activity with TSC-22 expression and knock-down of TSC-22 in HeLa cells. A promoter harboring a p53RE was activated by TSC-22 expression in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the promoter activity was decreased by TSC-22 knock-down. These data suggest that p53-mediated transcriptional activity is regulated by TSC-22 ( XREF_FIG ). To evaluate whether decreases in PUMA and p21 are caused by direct regulation of p53 by TSC-22, Flag-tagged TSC-22 plasmid was introduced into HCT116 p53 +/+  and p53 -/-  cells. Enhanced expression of PUMA was observed in p53 +/+  but not p53 -/-  cells ( XREF_FIG ). This result suggests that the regulation of PUMA and p21 by TSC22 is dependent on p53. To further explore the enhancement of p53 by TSC-22, we assessed p53 stability in Ad-TSC-22 or Ad-LacZ infected HeLa cells after cycloheximide treatment. As shown in  XREF_FIG  G, Ad-TSC-22 greatly enhanced and stabilized endogenous p53 levels. These results suggest that TSC-22 promotes the tumor suppressor function of p53 by enhancing the stability of p53 protein.\n\n\n\nTSC-22 Binds to p53 in vivo.\n\nTo determine whether TSC-22 interacts with p53 in mammalian cells, we transfected H1299 human lung non-small cell carcinoma cells with the Flag-TSC22 expression plasmid and ^p53 expression plasmid, and then conducted co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays. We found that TSC-22 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with p53 in cells expressing both Flag-TSC22 and p53, but not in cells expressing either protein alone ( XREF_FIG ). Conversely, p53 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with TSC-22 with the anti-Flag antibody ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting an interaction between TSC-22 and p53. Next, we tried to confirm the endogenous interaction between p53 and TSC-22. Since we could not purchase an appropriate TSC-22 antibody to use in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, this interaction was confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with endogenous p53 and exogenously expressed Flag-tagged TSC-22 in HEK293 cells which express high levels of p53 ( XREF_FIG ). The results suggest that TSC-22 directly interacts with p53.\n\n\n\nTSC-22 Binds to p53 in the Region Including Amino Acids 100 to 200.\n\nTo further define the region essential for binding TSC-22 to p53, we generated several p53 deletion mutants ( XREF_FIG ). Expression plasmids of p53 and TSC-22 were transfected into H1299 cells together or alone. As shown in  XREF_FIG , TSC-22 was able to bind to p53 several partial deletion mutants including p53 1-300 , p53 101-393 , and p53 1-200 . However, further deleting a portion of the internal region of the DNA binding domain, such as p53 1-100 , p53 201-393 , p53 301-393  and p53 201-300 , abolished p53-TSC22 binding ( XREF_FIG ). These results indicate that the region including amino acids 100-200, which is a part of the p53 DNA-binding domain, is required for binding TSC-22. Subsequently, to identify the p53 binding region of TSC-22, Flag-tagged truncated TSC-22 mutants that each contained an alpha-helix were expressed with p53 as shown in  XREF_FIG . In co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-p53 antibody (DO-1), TSC-22 54-154  was co-immunoprecipitated with p53, but TSC-22 1-110  and TSC-22 54-110  were not. These data suggest that p53 binds amino acids 110 to 154 of TSC-22. Unfortunately, we could not further confirm the detailed interaction of p53-TSC-22 because TSC-22 110-154  was not expressed in our experiment ( XREF_FIG ). Taken together, our data demonstrate that TSC-22 and p53 interact at specific domains in each protein.\n\n\n\nTSC22 Inhibits HDM2 and E6 -mediated p53 Poly-ubiquitination.\n\nTo determine whether enhancement of p53 stability by TSC-22 is due to inhibition of p53 ubiquitination, H1299 cells were transfected with HDM2, p53, and TSC-22 expression plasmids, and treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 for 6 h in order to conduct in vivo ubiquitination assays. As shown in  XREF_FIG , p53 was highly ubiquitinated with the expression of HDM2. However, further HDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination was significantly inhibited by the expression of TSC-22 ( XREF_FIG ). We next wanted to determine whether the inhibition of HDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination by TSC-22 is caused by interruption of the interaction between HDM2 and p53. Therefore, we introduced p53, HDM2, and TSC22 expression plasmids into H1299 cells as shown in  XREF_FIG . p53 was then immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts with the DO-1 antibody. Interestingly, this experiment showed that p53 was simultaneously bound to HDM2 and TSC-22. In addition, the p53-HDM2 interaction was not interrupted by expression of TSC-22. These data suggest that TSC-22 can protect p53 from HDM2-mediated ubiquitination by directly binding to p53 in a region separate from the HDM2 binding site.\n\nWe next attempted to show that TSC-22 can protect p53 from E6-mediated ubiquitination because the E6 and HDM2 binding domains of p53 overlap. p53 was highly ubiquitinated with the expression of E6 in H1299 cells ( XREF_FIG , Lane 3); however, further expression of TSC-22 clearly blocked E6-mediated p53 ubiquitination ( XREF_FIG , Lane 4). We next used HeLa cells that constitutively expressed E6 to examine TSC-22-mediated p53 stability under physiological conditions. Ubiquitination of p53 was greatly increased after MG132 treatment in the cells. In contrast, this ubiquitination clearly disappeared upon over-expression of TSC-22 ( XREF_FIG  D). p53 ubiquitination was rescued by the expression of shRNA specific for TSC-22 in HeLa cells in the absence of MG132 ( XREF_FIG , Lane 2). However, the difference in the level of p53 ubiquitination was not significant between sh-con and sh-TSC-22 cells in the presence of MG132. We further explored the effect of TSC-22 on p53 ubiquitination by the expression of both HDM2 and E6. As shown in  XREF_FIG , the level of p53 ubiquitination was dramatically induced by both HDM2 and E6. However both of HDM2 and E6-mediated p53 ubiquitination was tightly interrupted by TSC-22 expression ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, we tested whether TSC-22-p53 interaction is essential to inhibit p53 ubiquitination. As shown in  XREF_FIG -terminal deletion mutant TSC-22 110  which does not interact with p53 ( XREF_FIG ), did not inhibit the HDM2 and E6 mediated-p53 ubiquitination ( XREF_FIG ). This result reveal that TSC-22 inhibit the p53 ubiquitination via direct interaction. These data strongly suggest that TSC-22 directly interacts with p53 and blocks the E6 and/or HDM2-medidated p53 ubiquitination, followed by stabilizing the protein of p53.\n\n\n\nTSC-22 Suppresses Tumor Growth in Nude Mice.\n\nWe next determined whether TSC-22 inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Exponentially growing HeLa cervical cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into immune-deficient BALB/c nude mice. When the tumor volume reached about 100 mm 3 , 1x10 9  pfu of adenovirus expressing TSC-22 or LacZ were injected into the tumors. After three sequential intra-tumoral injections of adenovirus, the animals (5-7 per group) were monitored for tumor growth. Tumor growth and morphology were analyzed over 30 days.  XREF_FIG  shows that the tumor mass in mice injected with Ad-TSC-22 was remarkably reduced compared to tumors injected with Ad-LacZ or that were untreated. We next investigated the effect of TSC-22 on p53 stabilization in tumor tissues harvested from control and TSC-22 treated mice. TSC-22 transfection was observed to significantly increase the expression level of p53 protein ( XREF_FIG ). Collectively, these results clearly demonstrate that TSC-22 can be a potent tumor suppressor in this animal model.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn our search to identify genes associated with cervical cancer development, expression pattern analyses following cDNA microarray experiments and RT-PCR revealed that the TSC-22 gene was consistently reduced in tumor tissues ( XREF_FIG ). Several previous studies reported that TSC-22 is down-regulated in human salivary gland tumors  XREF_BIBR , mouse liver tumors  XREF_BIBR , and human brain tumors such as astrocytomas  XREF_BIBR . These results suggest that down-regulation of TSC-22 may play a role in the development of cancer in diverse tissues. However, these previous reports did not address the problem of TSC-22 being reduced in cancer cells. A reasonable explanation is that TSC-22 may inhibit cancer cell development. Our results showed that TSC-22 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death when expressed with an adenovirus expression system ( XREF_FIG ). Similarly, enhancement of TSC-22 expression is associated with increased apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma cells  XREF_BIBR .\n\nGiven that TSC-22 is a transcription repressor  XREF_BIBR , the role of TSC-22 in tumor suppression has been suggested by Mari et al.  XREF_BIBR . Through experiments using TSC-22 siRNA, this group demonstrated that the DNA damage-inducible gene 45 beta (Gadd45beta) and putative tumor suppressor 2 (Lzts2) are putative targets of TSC-22. However, the relationships through which these targets play pivotal roles in tumor suppression by TSC-22 were not directly revealed. In our attempt to find a novel function of TSC-22 in tumor suppression, we identified a binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid experiment. This study showed that TSC-22 directly binds to p53 ( XREF_FIG ). We further observed that TSC-22 up-regulated the protein levels of p53 without altering the levels of p53 mRNA. TSC-22 over-expression and knock-down experiments showed that TSC-22 facilitates the function of p53 as a transcriptional activator of target genes that can inhibit tumorigenesis ( XREF_FIG ). These results indicated that increased p53 protein levels are associated with post-translational regulation by TSC-22. TSC22-p53 interaction was assessed by in vivo assays in which p53 was co-immunoprecipitated with TSC-22 ( XREF_FIG - XREF_FIG ).\n\nOver-expression of TSC-22 clearly prevented ubiquitination of p53 by HDM2, which regulates p53 turnover through its E3 activity. Several regulators that influence p53 function via modulation of the HDM2-p53 interaction have been identified, including p14Arf  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , YY1  XREF_BIBR , gankyrin  XREF_BIBR , L11  XREF_BIBR , Daxx  XREF_BIBR , Numb  XREF_BIBR , and Nucleostemin  XREF_BIBR . Among these regulators, Numb is most similar to TSC-22 because Numb binds to p53 and HDM2, thereby preventing ubiquitination and degradation of p53  XREF_BIBR .\n\nIndeed, we detected a ternary complex that contains all three proteins: TSC-22, HDM2 and p53. Thus, TSC-22 does not compete with HDM2 for binding to p53. TSC-22 binds to the DNA binding domain of p53, which is essential for p53 function. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether this interaction is required to activate the target genes of p53 in the nucleus.\n\nInterestingly, increased cell death and inhibition of proliferation by TSC-22 expression were more frequently observed in HeLa cells, which constitutively express E6, than in Caski cells which do not express E6 ( XREF_FIG ). This seemed consistent with results shown in  XREF_FIG  demonstrating that p53 levels were more significantly restored in HeLa cells by expression of TSC-22 than in Caski cells ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nBased on the E6-p53 interaction  XREF_BIBR , p53 ubiquitination was spontaneously observed in HeLa cells even though the cells were not transfected with HDM2. However, p53 ubiquitination clearly disappeared upon over-expression of TSC-22 in HeLa cells ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, depletion of TSC-22 by shRNA induced p53 ubiquitination ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nWe also performed quantitative RT-PCT and found the suppressed mRNA level of p53 and TSC-22 and high expression level of E6 mRNA in cervical cancer cell lines and patients' tissue samples, but we could not find the physical correlation among them ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Although our results could not show the correlation of HPV/E6 and p53 protein expression level in cervical cancer tissues expressing less amount of TSC-22, it is well known that most of cervical cancer is caused by E6 expression after infection of human papillomavirus (HPV), followed by down-regulation of p53  XREF_BIBR . Taken together, our results imply that TSC-22 can suppress the oncogenic potential of HPV by preventing the degradation of p53 by E6-mediated ubiquitination. However, how TSC-22 inhibits ubiquitination and degradation promoted by HDM2 and E6 remains to be investigated in the future. In an attempt to address the effect of TSC-22 on tumor suppression in vivo, we found that the growth of HeLa cells inoculated into nude mice was significantly reduced by TSC-22 adenoviral transfection ( XREF_FIG ). This result suggests that TSC-22 could be targeted of future cancer gene therapies.\n\nIn conclusion, our study identified TSC-22 as a novel factor interacting with p53. We also showed that TSC-22 prevents the degradation of p53 protein by HDM2 and E6, which suggests a novel mechanism by which TSC-22 regulates apoptosis and cell proliferation. Our results also revealed a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying the effects of TSC-22 on tumor suppression, and demonstrated that TSC-22 is a possible new target for human cancer therapy.\n\n",
