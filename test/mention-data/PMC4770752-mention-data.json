      "text":"Identification of the beta-catenin/JNK/prothymosin-alpha axis as a novel target of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\n\n\n\nSorafenib is a kinase inhibitor used as anticancer drug against various human tumors, including advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). beta-Catenin and prothymosin alpha (PTMA) are overexpressed in HCC and other tumors. Previous studies have shown that PTMA expression modulates the response of HCC cells to sorafenib. However, the underlying mechanism of PTMA activity in this context remains unclear. We show here that sorafenib inhibits both beta-catenin and PTMA in a dose-dependent manner. Silencing beta-catenin reduces PTMA level and sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib. In contrast, ectopic expression of beta-catenin induces PTMA expression and cell resistance to the drug. Sorafenib inhibits PTMA expression at the transcriptional level by inhibiting the beta-catenin pathway. Nucleotide deletion analysis of the PTMA gene promoter reveals that a DNA segment lying 1,500-1,600 bp upstream of the PTMA transcription start site represents an AP-1-binding site that is critical for beta-catenin modulation of gene transcription in response to sorafenib. In addition, chemical inhibitors that target JNK abrogate beta-catenin/AP-1 binding to the endogenous PTMA gene and reduces PTMA transcription and protein expression. Silencing of beta-catenin or c-Fos induces similar effects on gene regulation and these are reversed by ectopic expression of beta-catenin. Mutations in the PTMA promoter at the predicted beta-catenin/AP-1 binding site partly abrogate sorafenib's effects on PTMA transcription. These results indicate that PTMA is induced by the oncoprotein beta-catenin and protects HCC cells against sorafenib-induced cell death. The beta-catenin/JNK/PTMA axis may thus represent a novel target for chemotherapy against HCC.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex liver disease associated with high mortality and prevalency worldwide, including in Southeast Asia and Taiwan [ XREF_BIBR ]. HCC patients often respond poorly to current clinical therapies, including chemotherapy. Poor prognosis and high mortality rates are attributed in part to the difficulty in obtaining a diagnosis at an early stage. Alterations, up-regulations and mutations in genes and cellular signaling pathways have been shown to promote hepatocarcinogenesis, even leading to protection of cancer cells against clinical treatment. Our previous studies showed that the anti-apoptotic protein HURP (hepatoma upregulated protein) and PTMA (prothymosin-alpha) [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ], which are upregulated in human HCC [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ], represent important targets of sorafenib in HCC cells cultured in vitro [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ].\n\nbeta-Catenin is involved in the development of many tumors, including HCC. Previous studies have shown that the beta-catenin protein can be modified by mutations, by inactivated APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) or the Wnt signaling pathway. These modifications induce beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and up-regulation of factors that act downstream of beta-catenin, such as TCF (T-cell factor) family-associated genes (c-Myc and cyclin D1), leading to initiation of carcinogenesis and cancer progression [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. A previous study also revealed that beta-catenin mutations are observed in different transgenic mouse HCC cell lines obtained by overexpression of the oncogenes c-myc or H-ras [ XREF_BIBR ]. beta-Catenin containing activating mutations is prevalent in human HCC patients and cancer cell lines [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], with a frequency of around 16% [ XREF_BIBR ]. beta-Catenin activation by extracellular Wnt family signals is also likely to promote cancer invasion and resistance to chemotherapy [ XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, targeting beta-catenin may represent an attractive option for the development of novel clinical therapies [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nSorafenib is a standard therapy for advanced HCC but provides limited survival benefits. This drug represents an anti-angiogenic multiple kinase inhibitor that induces cell death by targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, as well as VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet derived growth factor receptor)-beta, KIT, FLT-3, RET, and Wnt/beta-catenin [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Some studies have shown that inhibition of beta-catenin by sorafenib is observed in HCC cell lines, liver cancer stem cells, and mice bearing HepG2 cell-derived tumors [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. A recent study also shows that a combination of sorafenib and beta-catenin inhibitors produces synergistic effects in hepatoma cells [ XREF_BIBR ], suggesting that this strategy may represent a potential novel anti-cancer treatment. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of beta-catenin inhibition in sorafenib-induced cell death remains unclear.\n\nIn a previous report, PTMA expression and localization was shown to vary during hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis in rat hepatocytes [ XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, PTMA was found to be highly expressed in human HCC [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, the mechanism underlying regulation of PTMA expression and the possibility that this protein might produce anti-apoptotic effects in sorafenib-treated HCC cells have not been studied. High levels of PTMA and c-Myc co-expression were detected in various human tumors, including HCC [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. c-Myc was initially found to upregulate PTMA transcription [ XREF_BIBR ], and c-Myc-binding sites were identified in the proximal promoter and first intron of the PTMA gene [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. We recently found that PTMA may play a role in the development of human HCC as c-Myc-binding sites were detected in the proximal promoter of PTMA [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn the present study, we show that PTMA is upregulated by beta-catenin and that PTMA upregulation is inversely correlated with sorafenib sensitivity in HCC cells such as Mahlavu and J7. Notably, we identify a sorafenib-responsive element in the PTMA promoter, and demonstrate that sorafenib inhibits PTMA expression at the transcriptional level through inactivation of the beta-catenin/JNK pathway.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\nSorafenib-induced apoptosis is associated with down-regulation of beta-catenin and anti-apoptotic proteins.\n\nTo examine how sorafenib induces apoptosis in HCC cell lines, we monitored the proteins involved in the intrinsic and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways, including pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad, Bax, Bim, Bid, and PUMA) and anti-apoptotic proteins (survivin, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and PTMA). While Bax and Bid protein levels were slightly upregulated by sorafenib (at 20 muM but not 10 muM) in Mahlavu cells, the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin, Mcl-1 and PTMA were considerably down-regulated by the drug                    . Furthermore, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, which is associated with activation of cell surface death receptor, was activated to a low degree by sorafenib, as revealed by slight fragmentation of the anti-apoptotic protein FLIP and cleavage of caspase-8. Sorafenib also activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner in Mahlavu cells                    . These results suggest that sorafenib may kill HCC cells by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that beta-catenin may represent a target of sorafenib and a potential transcription factor that promotes chemoresistance through regulation of anti-apoptotic signals, such as survivin and Mcl-1 [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. We observed that a lethal dose of sorafenib down-regulated beta-catenin, survivin, Mcl-1, and PTMA in non-cancerous Chang liver and HCC cells (Huh7, SK-Hep1, Mahlavu, and J7)                                                             . IC 50  values produced by sorafenib varied in the HCC cell lines tested (the values are shown at the bottom of each Western blots in Figure  XREF_FIG ). Among the anti-apoptotic proteins tested, PTMA protein levels positively correlated with IC 50  values (R 2  = 0.76, Figure  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ; see also ref. [ XREF_BIBR ]). Decreased protein levels and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin were detected following sorafenib treatment                                   . While beta-catenin levels in whole cell extracts did not show a high degree of correlation with PTMA, beta-catenin in nuclear extracts showed excellent correlation with PTMA                                . Co-reduction of beta-catenin and PTMA was observed in the HCC cells examined (except Huh7, in which no change of beta-catenin levels was observed); yet, a substantial reduction of PTMA levels was noted following sorafenib treatment. Nuclear beta-catenin levels (or beta-catenin activity) and PTMA levels were inversely correlated with sorafenib sensitivity in most HCC cell lines. These results suggest that sorafenib-induced apoptosis in HCC cells may be attributed to down-regulation of beta-catenin and anti-apoptotic proteins and to activation of the caspase-9-dependent apoptosis pathway. Notably, total and nuclear beta-catenin levels were not reduced by ERK inhibition in HCC cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), an observation which contrasts with a previous study showing that the RAF1-p-ERK-beta-catenin pathway is required for expansion of breast cancer-initiating cells and enhanced cancer malignancy [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\n\n\nSilencing of beta-catenin down-regulates PTMA and enhances sorafenib-induced apoptosis.\n\nPrevious work showed that beta-catenin silencing decreases PTMA mRNA levels in glioma cells [ XREF_BIBR ], but the detailed mechanism underlying PTMA regulation remains unknown. To assess the role of beta-catenin in sorafenib-induced apoptosis, we silenced the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) using shRNA (shCTNNB1) in Mahlavu cells which express high levels of PTMA                    . Our results showed that CTNNB1 silencing induces a decrease of PTMA protein levels in sorafenib-treated cells                                   . While caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity increased following sorafenib treatment in Mahlavu cells, beta-catenin silencing induced the activity of the two caspases in untreated cells                                   . We also observed that shCTNNB1 sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib compared to shLuc control                    . Sensitization was quantified using a sensitization factor (SF 50 ), which was calculated by dividing the IC 50  of control cells by that of shCTNNB1 cells                                   . Sorafenib induced the accumulation of sub-G1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and silencing of CTNNB1 further enhanced the effects of sorafenib on sub-G1 cell levels                    . In contrast, ectopic expression of PTMA partly rescued shCTNNB1-induced sensitization to the drug as assessed by cell viability assay (with a resistance factor, RF 50  = 1.57) or sub-G1 cell analysis                                   . These results indicate that the sensitization effect of beta-catenin silencing to sorafenib involves PTMA.\n\n\n\nEctopic expression of beta-catenin up-regulates PTMA and reduces sorafenib-induced apoptosis.\n\nTo verify the role of beta-catenin and PTMA in regulating sorafenib-induced apoptosis, we overexpressed beta-catenin in HCC J7 cells which express low levels of PTMA                    . PTMA protein level increased following ectopic expression of beta-catenin                                   . While beta-catenin level was overexpressed 3.4 fold, PTMA protein levels doubled in the absence of sorafenib                                                              . Similar to the results obtained for Mahlavu cells, sorafenib reduced beta-catenin levels by 80% in J7 cells expressing the control pcDNA3 vector (Fig,  XREF_FIG , lanes 1 and 2). PTMA protein level was upregulated 3.9 fold following overexpression of beta-catenin in the presence of sorafenib                                                              . These results suggest that beta-catenin may be required, but not sufficient, for PTMA up-regulation. Sorafenib-induced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities, which both increased 2 fold, were partially inhibited by beta-catenin overexpression                                   . Sorafenib-induced inhibition of cell viability and sorafenib-induced sub-G1 cell accumulation were both significantly reversed by beta-catenin overexpression                                   . Furthermore, induction of cell resistance to sorafenib by beta-catenin overexpression was significantly reversed by PTMA silencing                                   . These results indicate that ectopic expression of beta-catenin up-regulates PTMA and induces resistance to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. In addition, these findings suggest that PTMA mediates the effects of beta-catenin on HCC cells.\n\n\n\nbeta-catenin silencing down-regulates PTMA mRNA level and PTMA promoter activity.\n\nWe have recently demonstrated that sorafenib down-regulates PTMA at the transcription level through c-Myc and that this phenomenon plays a significant role in regulating HCC cell sensitivity to the drug [ XREF_BIBR ]. Here, we found that beta-catenin plays an important role in up-regulating PTMA transcription. To assess the role of beta-catenin in the regulation of PTMA expression, we monitored PTMA mRNA levels in HCC cells following silencing or overexpression of beta-catenin. Sorafenib treatment (10 muM) or beta-catenin silencing (shCTNNB1) reduced PTMA mRNA levels by almost 50% in Mahlavu cells                    . PTMA mRNA levels were not further reduced in cells expressing shCTNNB1                    . Similar results were obtained when PTMA protein levels were monitored                    . Sorafenib also reduced PTMA mRNA levels in J7 cells                    . In addition, we detected a significant increase of PTMA mRNA levels following ectopic expression of beta-catenin in J7 cells                    . The effects produced by sorafenib or beta-catenin on PTMA mRNA levels were similar to that observed earlier for the PTMA protein in J7 cells                    . Notably, inhibition of PTMA mRNA and protein levels by sorafenib could be rescued by ectopic expression of beta-catenin. While silencing of beta-catenin (shCTNNB1) down-regulated the transactivation activity of the isolated PTMA promoter pGL3-PTMA by 30% (P < 0.05) [ XREF_BIBR ] compared to control Mahlavu cells (shCtl), ectopic expression of beta-catenin enhanced the promoter activity by over 3.5 fold (P < 0.01) compared to control (GFP)                                   . Up-regulation of PTMA promoter by beta-catenin overexpression was also observed in J7 cells (P < 0.05)                              . These results indicate that down-regulation of PTMA transcription by sorafenib is mediated by beta-catenin. Our findings also suggest that the control of PTMA expression by sorafenib occurs mainly via the action of beta-catenin on transcription.\n\n\n\nIdentification of a putative beta-catenin-responsive element in the PTMA gene promoter.\n\nTo identify putative beta-catenin-responsive elements in the PTMA promoter, we performed a series of deletion from the 5'-end of the pGL-PTMA promoter (2.5 kb) in Mahlavu cells                    . Basal transcription analysis revealed negatively- and positively-regulated elements in the -2023/-1639 and -1503/-1027 segments, respectively                    . While activity of the 1.6 kb promoter was significantly down-regulated by beta-catenin silencing (shCTNNB1) compared to shCtl control, the 1.5 kb promoter showed activity similar to that of the 2.5 kb promoter                    , suggesting that the -1639/-1503 segment may contain a putative beta-catenin-responsive element                    . Basal expression pattern of these plasmid truncates, with similar negatively- and positively-regulated elements, was also found in J7 cells                    . While the 1.6 kb truncated plasmid displayed significant activation following beta-catenin overexpression, the 1.5 kb plasmid showed significant reduction in transactivity                    . These results suggest that the -1639/-1503 segment of the PTMA promoter is critical for the response to beta-catenin.\n\n\n\nCharacterization of the beta-catenin-responsive element in PTMA promoter activation: overlap with AP-1 and TCF4 enhancers.\n\nTranscription activity and critical segments for basal and regulated expression of the 2.5-Kb PTMA promoter was identified (see above). The PTMA promoter region contains a few major transcription factor sites                    . The beta-catenin-responsive region appears to overlap with AP-1, C/EBPbeta and CREB elements. beta-catenin always regulates gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors, such as TCF4 [ XREF_BIBR ]. To verify the involvement of beta-catenin and other transcription factors in activating the PTMA promoter, we created mutations in these predicted transcription factor-binding sites in the PTMA promoter, including for mAP1, mCREB, and mTCF4                    . While wild-type promoter activity was suppressed 0.48 fold by sorafenib in Mahlavu cells, the activity of the AP1, TCF4 and combined AP1/TCF4 mutant promoters was suppressed 0.60 fold, 0.82 fold and 1.00 fold, respectively                    . On the other hand, the CREB mutant promoter activity displayed the same level of sorafenib-induced suppression as the wild-type promoter. These results indicate that mutation in AP1 and TCF4 binding sequences reduced the suppression induced by the drug. Suppression of promoter activity of mAP1, mTCF4 and combined mAP1/mTCF4, but not mCREB, was significantly reduced by beta-catenin silencing                    . Furthermore, potentiation of promoter activity by beta-catenin overexpression was reduced for mAP1, mTCF4 and combined mAP1/mTCF4, but not for mCREB, compared to wild-type promoter in J7 cells                    . These results indicate that AP1 and TCF4 binding sites are involved in the regulation of PTMA gene expression by sorafenib and beta-catenin. Early studies have identified physical interactions between beta-catenin and AP1 in stimulating TCF4-dependent gene expression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. The promoter with double mutations at the AP1 and TCF4 binding sites displayed greater reduction of activity following sorafenib treatment than the single mutant AP1 or TCF4, suggesting that AP1 and TCF4 enhancers may overlap with beta-catenin on the PTMA gene.\n\n\n\nCharacterization of beta-catenin-responsive element in the PTMA gene using ChIP assay: sorafenib-induced inhibition of beta-catenin, AP-1 and TCF4 binding separately or in combination.\n\nChIP assays were used to verify binding of the transcription factors to the promoter region of PTMA gene (the location of PCR primers is shown in Figure  XREF_FIG ). We found that beta-catenin, TCF4, c-Fos, and CREB interacted with both AP1-binding sequence (AP1BS or 1500-1600-bp region) and TCF4-binding sequence (TCF4BS or 1000-1100-bp region) upstream of the transcription start site                    . Significant decrease in the binding of these factors to both regions was observed following sorafenib treatment (10 muM), except for TCF4 in the TCF4BS region                                             . These results indicate that binding of beta-catenin, TCF4, and c-Fos to AP1BS is inhibited by sorafenib. Interestingly, TCF4 interacted better with AP1BS than TCF4BS (over 10 fold). However, TCF4 binding at TCF4BS was increased, and binding at the AP1BS was inhibited by sorafenib. These results suggest that TCF4 binding to AP1BS may occur through formation of a complex with AP-1 and/or beta-catenin. c-Myc binding was used as a control that could be detected at the TCF4BS region but not at AP1BS [ XREF_BIBR ]. These binding activities were not detected in the exon-5 region where no such binding sequences exist. Binding of the beta-catenin/TCF4/c-Fos complex to the PTMA promoter and inhibition by sorafenib treatment (10 muM) was also investigated using re-ChIP assay. IP was performed from nuclear extracts first with the beta-catenin or c-Fos antibody, followed by treatment with the indicated second antibodies. The results revealed binding of beta-catenin/TCF4 or beta-catenin/c-Fos complexes to both AP1BS and TCF4BS in Mahlavu and J7 cells, and these effects were significantly reduced by sorafenib (P < 0.05; Figure  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). We noted that beta-catenin/TCF4 binding at AP1BS was 3.5 fold higher than binding at TCF4BS. As seen in ChIP assays, the binding results observed in re-ChIP assays were not detected in the negative control immunoprecipitated with either IgG or PCR at exon 5. In addition, beta-catenin did not interact with CREB in CREB-binding element of the PTMA gene, indicating that CREB was not involved in this regulation. In contrast, using c-Fos as first antibody to conduct IP followed by beta-catenin as second antibody also resulted in strong binding to the AP1BS, and less binding to the TCF4BS. Both beta-catenin/c-Fos binding were inhibited by sorafenib in Mahlavu and J7 cells                                             . These results suggest that down-regulation of PTMA transcription by sorafenib may depend on beta-catenin/TCF4/AP1 complex binding to the enhancer AP1BS as well as TCF4BS.\n\n\n\nInhibition of AP-1 down-regulates PTMA protein and mRNA levels and potentiates sorafenib-induced apoptosis.\n\nOur previous study showed that the JNK pathway is involved in PTMA expression [ XREF_BIBR ]. To verify if the effects of beta-catenin on PTMA transcription involves JNK/AP1, we performed experiments to inhibit JNK/AP1. First, we examined whether c-Fos regulates PTMA expression. PTMA protein and mRNA levels decreased following c-Fos silencing in Mahlavu cells compared to shLuc-expressing cells                                . beta-catenin protein levels also decreased after c-Fos silencing                    . While beta-catenin level was dramatically reduced by sorafenib, the level of c-Fos protein remained unchanged                                                          . Caspase-3 activation was enhanced by sorafenib treatment in cells in which c-Fos was silenced compared to shLuc expressing cells                    . Furthermore, induction of sub-G1 cells and inhibition of cell viability by sorafenib were potentiated by c-Fos silencing in Mahlavu cells                                   . These results indicate that silencing of c-Fos reduces beta-catenin and PTMA expression levels and sensitizes cells to sorafenib.\n\nTo assess the importance of JNK/AP1 in beta-catenin-mediated regulation of PTMA expression, we inhibited AP1 activity in J7 cells using JNK inhibitor (JNKi). beta-Catenin and PTMA protein and mRNA levels were reduced by JNKi in cells expressing the pcDNA3 vector or beta-catenin                               . Notably, increase of PTMA protein and mRNA levels was prevented following ectopic expression of beta-catenin and JNKi treatment. While caspase-3 activity increased following JNKi treatment in J7 cells, ectopic expression of beta-catenin moderately reduced caspase-3 activity                    . Sub-G1 cells increased in a dose-dependent manner in sorafenib-treated cells. JNKi treatment further enhanced the levels of sub-G1 cells in the J7 cell line                                . Ectopic expression of beta-catenin reversed the level of sub-G1 cells compared to control vector                                 . While cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner following sorafenib treatment in J7 cells, JNKi treatment sensitized the cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorfenib in cells overexpressing either the vector or beta-catenin                                                                                             . IC 50  values of 3.54 muM and 6.61 muM in control and beta-catenin-overexpressing cells were observed, respectively, with resistance factor of 1.87, indicating the protective role of beta-catenin in this context. Resistance factor of 2.12 (IC 50  = 4.88 divided by IC 50  = 2.30) in beta-catenin-overexpressing cells was observed in the presence of JNKi. These effects were unlikely to represent off-target activities since the specificity of JNK inhibitor was tested in Mahlavu cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest that PTMA expression is stimulated by JNK-dependent beta-catenin expression, and that the expression level of these genes is critical to determine cell sensitivity to sorafenib.\n\n\n\nSorafenib potentiates the degradation of beta-catenin mRNA.\n\nThe protein level of beta-catenin following treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, for 12 or 24 hrs did not vary in the absence or presence of sorafenib                    . However, different protein levels were observed after 48 hrs of CHX treatment                    , indicating that the degradation rate of beta-catenin was slightly enhanced by sorafenib. Previous studies have shown that dysregulation of the Wnt pathway which involves beta-catenin and p-GSK3beta is critical for beta-catenin degradation in HCC [ XREF_BIBR ]. To further assess the regulation of beta-catenin expression by sorafenib, we examined the possible upstream kinase signal pathway that may regulate beta-catenin expression. While the protein levels of beta-catenin and PTMA were down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner by sorafenib (24 hrs) in Mahlavu cells, the phosphorylated form of GSK3beta(p-GSK3beta) increased                    .\n\nWe also found a slight increase of PTMA protein level in cells treated with the GSK3beta inhibitor, whereas beta-catenin protein levels remained unchanged                    . These results suggest that the decrease of PTMA in sorafenib-treated Mahlavu cells is unlikely to be due to enhanced degradation of beta-catenin via GSK3beta activity. On the other hand, we found decreased beta-catenin mRNA levels and enhanced mRNA degradation rate following sorafenib treatment as revealed by the reduced mRNA levels in cells treated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Act. D)                                   . While the total levels of beta-catenin mRNA and protein were down-regulated by JNK inhibitor, the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin protein and the degradation rates of beta-catenin mRNA and protein were not affected ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results demonstrate that down-regulation of beta-catenin expression by sorafenib is controlled by enhancement of mRNA degradation, in addition to inhibition of transactivation of the gene.\n\n\n\nHigh levels of beta-catenin and PTMA in clinical tumors.\n\nWhether our findings in cell lines can be extrapolated to clinical samples and cancer patients remains to be examined. However, we observed that RNA levels of CTNNB1, PTMA, and c-Myc correlate with poor survival in HCC patients ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY - XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In addition, the expression level of CTNNB1 and PTMA was higher in HCC than in control healthy liver tissues ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY - XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). As for CTNNB1 and PTMA, the expression level of c-Myc was also higher in advanced HCC compared to early tumors ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Apparently, the observation that RNA levels of CTNNB1 and PTMA were higher in HCC than in control healthy liver tissues could not fully explain cancer sensitivity to the drug. In addition, correlation between beta-catenin and PTMA mRNA levels was poor in these clinical tumors ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). A study of the nuclear expression of beta-catenin protein and/or its activity is required to elucidate the possible role of this protein in regulation of PTMA expression and sorafenib sensitivity in clinical tumors. Although only a few HCC cell lines were tested in this study, these cell lines (except Huh7) displayed good correlation between beta-catenin activity and PTMA protein levels. This observation suggests that their expression level may serve a potential marker of sorafenib sensitivity.\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nIn this study, we found that down-regulation of PTMA in response to sorafenib occurs through inhibition of the beta-catenin pathway and that this process contributes to the cell killing effects of sorafenib in HCC cells. Induction of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and the cell killing effects of sorafenib are associated with PTMA levels in HCC cells. Furthermore, silencing of beta-catenin results in down-regulation of PTMA expression and cell sensitization to the drug, effects which can be rescued by PTMA overexpression. These observations support the conclusion that the beta-catenin/PTMA pathway plays an important role in modulating HCC sensitivity to sorafenib. We further demonstrated that the regulation of PTMA expression by beta-catenin occurs at the transcription level, specifically in processes involving gene transactivation and maintenance of mRNA stability. As evidenced by the gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments described here, we identified that the PTMA gene is activated by beta-catenin in cooperation with AP-1 targeting to the AP-1 enhancer of the PTMA gene segment where the mediator TCF4 [ XREF_BIBR ] is also involved. In the presence of sorafenib, beta-catenin is likely to be down-regulated at the transcription level, and the beta-catenin/AP1/TCF4 complex may fail to form, leading to inhibition of PTMA gene transactivation                    . During this process, TCF4 is also involved in beta-catenin/AP-1 complex binding to AP1BS for PTMA gene activation. Interestingly, the binding of TCF4 to AP1BS in the PTMA gene is stronger than the binding to TCF4BS. In the presence of sorafenib, the binding of TCF4 to AP1BS is inhibited whereas binding to TCF4BS is induced                    . This is probably due to down-regulation of beta-catenin/AP-1 by the drug since beta-catenin/AP-1 complex binding to AP1BS is sensitive to the drug                    . Thus, activation of PTMA gene involves the beta-catenin/AP-1/TCF4 complex and is negatively regulated by sorafenib in HCC cells. Our findings provide evidence linking the surviving/oncogenic protein beta-catenin to the antiapoptotic factor PTMA. Inhibition of this axis sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib, suggesting that this strategy may help control the growth of this cancer.\n\nWe also found that sorafenib down-regulates PTMA expression in HCC cells, a process which depends on nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, a hallmark of Wnt pathway activation. While phosphorylation of GSK3betaincreases following sorafenib treatment, beta-catenin and PTMA are down-regulated in sorafenib-treated HCC cells                    . The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway appears to be a prominent target of sorafenib in HCC. Indeed, 40-70% of HCCs harbor nuclear accumulation of the beta-catenin protein [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. As seen for other tumors, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a critical contributor to HCC pathogenesis, and proteins identified in this pathway are potential candidates for pharmacological interventions [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, our results did not elucidate the effects of beta-catenin mutations which may affect cell functions such as oncogenesis and treatment efficacy. Activating mutations in the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) occur in 8-30% of tumors, while loss-of-function/mutations in APC and Axin genes occur in 1-3% and 8-15%, respectively, and are mutually exclusive to CTNNB1 mutations [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. While some observations suggest that CTNNB1 mutations could be a late event during hepatocarcinogenesis, beta-catenin accumulation was detected in the early stage during the development of HCC, suggesting that other mechanisms could contribute to beta-catenin stabilization [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. The cell lines used in the present study were derived from advanced HCC cases and they express various levels of beta-catenin. Although silencing CTNNB1 (which led to reduction of PTMA levels) sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib, we still do not know whether CTNNB1 mutations occurred in these HCC cell lines.\n\nA recent review summarized the potential Wnt-component targets for therapeutic intervention on tumor development and growth [ XREF_BIBR ]. While beta-catenin activation may cooperate with non-canonical pathways such as insulin/IGF-1/IRS-1/MAPK during hepatocarcinogenesis in mice [ XREF_BIBR ], our study on sorafenib-induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines reveals the involvement of beta-catenin and MAPK/AP-1. Inhibition of AP-1 by shRNA or chemical inhibitor down-regulates beta-catenin protein levels, suggesting that beta-catenin acts downstream of AP-1. These two pathways may be muturally regulated and thus be impaired by downregulation of either one. Accordingly, beta-catenin activation may cooperate with MAPK/AP-1 to potentiate PTMA transcription. In this context, the mechanisms underlying the development of chemoresistance may partly overlap with that of beta-catenin-associated oncogenesis. Additionally, we found that oncogenic c-Myc activates PTMA and represents a potent target of sorafenib in HCC cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. These results support the notion that activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes during tumor development reduce treatment sensitivity, and are potential therapeutic targets to reduce chemoresistance [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nWe present new findings linking beta-catenin activity with expression of the PTMA protein. We showed previously that PTMA modulates the sensitivity of HCC cells to the kinase inhibitor sorafenib [ XREF_BIBR ]. Sorafenib was shown to downregulate beta-catenin and beta-catenin activity through the JNK pathway, a process which was associated with suppressed PTMA activity. We also found that CTNNB1 mRNA level is downregulated by sorafenib through inhibition of the AP-1/JNK pathway, possibly via transactivation inhibition. However, the mechanism by which beta-catenin is altered by sorafenib remains unclear. These cellular processes enhance apoptosis and partly overcome drug resistance. A simplified model is presented and includes the effects of the beta-catenin/AP-1/TCF4 axis and the c-Myc/Max axis in the regulation of PTMA transactivation                    . Nevertheless, how these molecules interact and contribute to PTMA expression still remains to be elucidated. As for the down-regulation of PTMA, we also found that sorafenib down-regulates the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and Mcl-1 in HCC cells. We have previously demonstrated the protective role of HURP (which acts upstream of survivin) and Mcl-1 against sorafenib in HCC and endometrial carcinoma cells, respectively [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. The possible involvement of these proteins in modulating sorafenib response in HCC cells and the link between such proteins and beta-catenin need to be examined in further studies.\n\nIn conclusion, our observation that PTMA plays a critical role in HCC progression and drug resistance is an important finding that may lead to the development of novel cancer therapies. Compounds such as sorafenib that potently interfere with signaling pathways and effectors (e.g., PTMA) that are required for HCC progression may be used to treat selected human patients and improve current therapies against HCC.\n\n",
