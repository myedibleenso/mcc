      "text":"miR-142 regulates the tumorigenicity of human breast cancer stem cells through the canonical WNT signaling pathway.\n\n\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of stem and progenitor cell functions. We previously reported that miR-142 and miR-150 are upregulated in human breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) as compared to the non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that miR-142 efficiently recruits the APC mRNA to an RNA-induced silencing complex, activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in an APC-suppression dependent manner, and activates the expression of miR-150. Enforced expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in normal mouse mammary stem cells resulted in the regeneration of hyperproliferative mammary glands in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous miR-142 effectively suppressed organoid formation by BCSCs and slowed tumor growth initiated by human BCSCs in vivo. These results suggest that in some tumors, miR-142 regulates the properties of BCSCs at least in part by activating the WNT signaling pathway and miR-150 expression.\n\nDOI:\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01977.001\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionally conserved small non-coding RNAs that regulate the translation of mRNAs. They are recruited to an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and bind to the seed sequence within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to destabilization and/or translational suppression of the target mRNAs ( XREF_BIBR ). The immunopurification (IP) of Argonaute (Ago), a central component of the RISC in the human and mouse, followed by microarray analyses (Ago IP/microarray method) makes it possible to isolate any Ago-associated miRNAs and mRNAs without relying on the mechanism of regulation (i.e. mRNA decay or translational suppression), or sequence conservation, enabling a comprehensive identification of the miRNA-target genes in an unbiased manner. This provides quantitative information about the mRNAs that are regulated by miRNAs ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ).\n\nmiRNAs are able to regulate the expression of hundreds of target mRNAs simultaneously and control a variety of cell functions including cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation ( XREF_BIBR ). We previously identified a human breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) population (a CD44 +  CD24 -/low  lineage -  population of human breast cancer cells) that in many human breast tumors is enriched for the ability to drive tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model as compared to the remaining non-tumorigenic cancer cells (NTG cells) within the same breast tumor ( XREF_BIBR ). Comprehensive analyses of the expression profile of 466 miRNAs revealed that 37 miRNAs are differentially expressed between the human BCSCs and NTG cells ( XREF_BIBR ). Among them, both miR-200c and miR-183 are downregulated in the human BCSCs and suppress the protein expression of the stem cell self-renewal gene, BMI1, and miR-200c suppresses the protein expression of the EMT regulator ZEB1 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Enforced expression of miR-200c can strongly suppress the tumor formation driven by human BCSCs and the mammary ducts formation by normal mammary stem cells in vivo, suggesting that miR-200c is a regulator of normal mammary and BCSCs. On the other hand, the expression of miRNAs, such as miR-142, miR-150, and miR-155, are upregulated in human BCSCs ( XREF_BIBR ). Among them, miR-155 was originally identified as a product of the oncogenic BIC gene locus in B cell lymphoma ( XREF_BIBR ). Abnormal proliferation and myelodysplasia are seen when miR-155 expression is sustained in the blood system ( XREF_BIBR ). Furthermore, miR-155 functions as an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers, including leukemia and breast cancers ( XREF_BIBR ). Dysregulation of miR-142 and miR-150 are reported in leukemia, gastric and lung cancers, but their roles in breast cancer or BCSCs are not elucidated. miR-142 is involved in hematopoiesis, immune responses, and T cell differentiation ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) and is upregulated in bronchoalveolar stem cells ( XREF_BIBR ), suggesting it might have a role in the regulation of tissue stem cells. miR-142 is upregulated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( XREF_BIBR ) but is downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia ( XREF_BIBR ). miR-150 is upregulated in adult T-cell leukemia cells ( XREF_BIBR ), gastric cancers ( XREF_BIBR ), and lung cancers ( XREF_BIBR ).\n\nThe canonical Wnt pathway signal is transduced by beta-catenin and plays a critical role in many adult stem cells, including those of the breast and intestine ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). The fact that some cancer cells share the extended self-renewal ability with normal stem cells, and that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is implicated in both stem cell self-renewal and cancer suggests that normal physiological regulators of stem cell functions might be 'hijacked' in cancer ( XREF_BIBR ). A variety of putative transcriptional targets of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, such as c-Myc and cyclin D1, are identified ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a component of the destruction complex that destabilizes beta-catenin and suppresses the activity of the canonical WNT signaling pathway. In human colon cancers, mutations in the APC gene are the most commonly known acquired genetic change for the aberrant activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway during the tumor development and progression ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). In a model for the stepwise progression of the colon tumorigenesis, APC gene mutations play an important role in the initiation step followed by successive mutations in other genes, including K-Ras and p53 ( XREF_BIBR ). During clonal progression, dysregulation of downstream beta-catenin targets, such as c-Myc, can relieve colon cancer cells of their dependence on beta-catenin signaling ( XREF_BIBR ). The expression of APC is not limited to the intestine but is widely observed in many other tissues, including lung, liver, kidney, and mammary tissue. However, the role of the suppression of APC and the activation of the canonical WNT signaling in the tumor initiation process of the tissues other than the colon largely remains unknown, because APC mutations are less frequent in tumors originating from these tissues. For example, recent data from the TCGA reveals an ~2% incidence of APC mutations in breast cancer (the TCGA Research Network: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/).\n\nDampening of APC inhibition of beta-catenin appears to be more often due to promoter methylation (36-54%) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (23%) than to somatically acquired APC mutations (~2%) in human breast cancers ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ), but the presence of the APC promoter methylation and LOH are independent of tumor size or stage ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). The APC mutations in breast cancers are typically found at sites distinct from the APC mutation cluster region in colorectal cancers and are much more frequently seen in advanced than early stage breast cancers ( XREF_BIBR ). On the other hand, APC is targeted by the miRNAs, such as miR-27, miR-155, and miR-142 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). These observations suggest that in addition to LOH, promoter methylation, and the APC mutations, miRNAs that target APC may regulate the aberrant activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway for the initiation of human breast cancers, the enhancement of niche independence, and the aberrant proliferation of the human BCSCs.\n\nIn this study, we studied the roles of miR-142 and miR-150, two of the miRNAs that are upregulated in the human BCSCs, in the enhancement of the canonical WNT signaling pathway and in the regulation of human BCSCs. We employed the Ago IP/microarray method to show the relevance of the targeting of APC by miR-142, but not by miR-150, and identified various target mRNAs that were efficiently recruited to RISC by these miRNAs. Upregulation of miR-142 enhanced the canonical WNT signaling pathway and transactivated the expression of miR-150. Both microRNAs had the ability to induce hyperproliferation in mammary tissue. Finally, we show that knockdown of miR-142 reduced the clonogenicity of BCSCs in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Our results provide the insights into the roles and mechanisms of two of the upregulated miRNAs in human BCSCs.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nmiR-142 efficiently recruits the APC mRNA to a RISC.\n\nmiRNAs suppress protein production by recruiting target mRNAs to the RISC where they associate with Ago, a core component of the RISC. To explore the possible target mRNAs of miR-142 and miR-150 which were more highly expressed in human BCSCs than in the NTG cells, we performed Ago IP/microarray to comprehensively identify mRNAs that were recruited to Ago by miR-142 and miR-150. Lysates from human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293T cells transfected with or without the precursor for miR-142 or miR-150 were immunopurified using an anti-Ago antibody. Amplified RNAs from the Ago-immunopurified samples were labeled and hybridized to the Human Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide (HEEBO) microarrays ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). We identified dozens of potential targets of miR-142 and miR-150 ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The types of miRNA seed match (i.e. the association of target mRNA with the region centered on the nucleotides 2-7 of the 5' region of miRNAs) correlate with the efficiency of mRNA targeting by miRNAs ( XREF_BIBR ). The efficiency of the miR142-dependent and miR-150-dependent recruitment of specific mRNAs to the RISC complex correlated well with the types of miRNA seed matches: mRNAs with the 8mer match were most efficiently enriched, followed by those with the 7mer-m8, 7mer-1A, and 6mer sites ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ). Although both miR-142 and miR-150 were predicted to target the APC mRNA by a computer algorithm, the results of the Ago IP/microarray experiments showed that the APC mRNA was efficiently recruited to RISC by miR-142, and that it was hardly recruited to RISC by miR-150 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Among the genes associated with the activity of the WNT signaling pathway, we found that the APC mRNA was strongly recruited to Ago by miR-142 ( XREF_FIG ). In the parallel experiments, amplified RNAs from the whole cell lysate from HEK293T cells transfected with or without the miR-142 precursor were labeled and hybridized to the HEEBO microarrays. The results showed that the abundance of the APC mRNA was consistently reduced in the miR-142-transfected HEK293T cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\n\n\nmiR-142 directly targets APC and activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway.\n\nWe tested the ability of miR-142 to regulate the 3' UTR of the APC mRNA using a luciferase reporter assay. The 3' UTR of the APC mRNA, which contained a predicted target site for miR-142-3p was cloned into the pGL3-MC vector downstream of a luciferase minigene ( XREF_FIG ). HEK293T cells, which very weakly express miR-142, were co-transfected with the pGL3 luciferase-APC 3'UTR vector, or the control luciferase vector, pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector, and miRNA precursors. We observed that when the 3' UTR of the APC mRNA was included in the luciferase transcript, co-transfection of the miR-142 precursor suppressed the luciferase activity by 37% ( XREF_FIG ). Mutations of the two nucleotides within the predicted target site for miR-142-3p in the 3' UTR of the APC mRNA significantly weakened the ability of miR-142 to suppress the luciferase activity ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting that miR-142 specifically targets the predicted seed sequence in the 3' UTR of the APC mRNA to suppress the translation of the APC mRNA.\n\nThen we tested the ability of miR-142 to regulate expression of endogenous APC protein. Western blot analyses showed that, after 6 days, the protein level of APC was decreased in the HEK293T cells expressing miR-142 when compared to the control precursor transfected cells ( XREF_FIG ). To confirm our findings, breast cancer cells, such as MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, were transfected with the miR-142 precursor. We found that the protein level of APC was reduced in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells ( XREF_FIG ). Next, the expression of miR-142-3p was knocked down using an anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus in the HEK293T, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7 cells which expressed miR-142 at low levels. We found that the protein level of APC was elevated in HEK293T, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7 cells transduced with the anti-miR-142-3p vector ( XREF_FIG  and data not shown). These results suggest that miR-142 effectively targets the APC mRNA and reduces the protein level of APC in the cells including the human breast cancer cells.\n\nInhibition of APC expression by miR-142 could, in principle, diminish the dependence of the canonical WNT signaling pathway on extrinsic WNT signals. To test this possibility, we evaluated the effects of miR-142 on the beta-catenin-dependent transcription of the luciferase gene using cells transfected with a TOPFlash luciferase plasmid, which contained the beta-catenin/TCF binding sites in the promoter region of a luciferase gene. As a control, cells were transfected with an otherwise identical FOPFlash plasmid, in which the beta-catenin/TCF binding sites were mutated. The ratio of the measured luciferase activity of the TOPFlash plasmid to that of the FOPFlash plasmid provides a measure of the activity of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling in the cells ( XREF_BIBR ). HEK293T cells were transfected with the miR-142 precursor and incubated with 20 mM lithium chloride (LiCl) for 6 hr to stimulate the canonical WNT signaling pathway (by inhibiting the activity of the glycogen synthase kinase 3) ( XREF_BIBR ). We found that the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash ratio of the luciferase activities increased by 364% in the miR-142 transfected HEK293T cells compared to that in the control precursor transfected cells ( XREF_FIG ). In accordance with this result, the elevation of the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash value in the miR-142 transfected cells was observed by the stimulation with Wnt3A ( XREF_FIG ). To further confirm that miR-142 activated the canonical WNT signaling pathway by targeting APC, we co-transfected the APC expression plasmid, pCMV-Neo-APC, that contains the complete coding sequence and the partial 3' UTR sequence of the APC mRNA, along with the TOPFlash or FOPFlash vectors and the miRNA precursors. The miR-142-3p target site within the pCMV-Neo-APC plasmid sequence was mutated to produce the pCMV-APC mutant plasmid ( XREF_FIG ). The co-transfection of the control plasmid, pCMV-Neo-Control, or the pCMV-Neo-APC plasmid that contains miR-142-3p targeted sequence within the 3' UTR region, did not affect the ability of miR-142 to elevate the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash value. On the contrary, co-transfection of pCMV-Neo-APC mutant plasmid significantly suppressed the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash value to an intensity comparable to that of the control miRNA precursor transfected cells ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that the activation of canonical WNT signaling pathway by miR-142 is mostly mediated by the ability of miR-142 to reduce the protein level of APC.\n\n\n\nInhibition of miR-142 suppresses the clonogenicity of BCSCs.\n\nThe organoid culture system of the mammary tumor cells allows the in vitro formation of the organoids that maintain cellular hierarchy of the original tissue from which it derived ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). In this system, the tissue derived stem cells were embedded in Matrigel and cultured in the media that contained a cocktail of the growth factors, including ones that stimulate the WNT signaling pathways. We and others have previously shown that the MLTV-Wnt-1 tumor contains a CSC population ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Because miR-142 is upregulated in the BCSCs and stimulates the canonical WNT signaling pathway that is an important regulator of the stem cell properties in mammary tissues, we tested the ability of miR-142 to regulate the organoid formation of BCSCs. The sorted murine mammary CSCs of the MLTV-Wnt-1 tumor were infected with the control lentivirus or the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus that suppressed the expression of miR-142-3p and expressed GFP. The GFP-positive cells infected with the control lentivirus formed round-shaped organoids in 7 days ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, most of the cells infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentiviruses failed to form the round-shaped organoids ( XREF_FIG ). The number of the GFP positive organoids was significantly decreased when the mammary CSCs were infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that miR-142-3p is an important regulator of the organoid formation ability in murine mammary CSCs.\n\nTo confirm that these findings are applicable to the human BCSCs, we infected the human breast cancer cells with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentiviruses and evaluated the ability to form the organoids derived from the human BCSCs. BCSCs of the human breast cancer xenograft tumors were infected with the control lentivirus or the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentiviruses. The GFP positive cells infected with the control lentivirus formed round-shaped organoids in 10 days ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, most of the cells infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentiviruses failed to form the round-shaped organoids ( XREF_FIG ). The number of the GFP positive organoids was significantly decreased when the human BCSCs were infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus ( XREF_FIG ). Then we analyzed the effects of miR-142 on the cell proliferation and apoptosis of the cancer cells in the organoids. The organoids were incubated with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and the percentage of the EdU positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that the percentage of the EdU-positive cells in the GFP-positive organoids was significantly reduced when the human BCSCs were infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus ( XREF_FIG ). Then we analyzed the percentage of apoptotic cells in the GFP-positive organoids by flow cytometry. We found that the percentage of the annexin V-positive cells in the GFP positive organoids was significantly increased when the human BCSCs were infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that miR-142 critically affects the clonogenic properties of the BCSCs by regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of the breast cancer cells.\n\n\n\nmiR-142 upregulates the transcription of miR-150 through the canonical WNT signaling pathway.\n\nBoth miR-142 and miR-150 are more highly expressed in BCSCs relative to the non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells ( XREF_BIBR ). Because the promoter region of miR-150 contains a potential beta-catenin/TCF transcription factor binding site ( XREF_FIG ), we investigated whether miR-150 expression is regulated by the canonical WNT signaling pathway. HEK293T cells were stimulated with 20 mM LiCl for 7 hr, then crosslinked with formaldehyde, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed either with an antibody against beta-catenin or, as a control, with mouse IgG. The anti-beta-catenin antibody selectively enriched DNA fragments containing the potential beta-catenin/TCF binding site within the promoter of the miR-150 precursor ( XREF_FIG ). Then, using semi-quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the expression of miR-142 was able to upregulate the expression of miR-150 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells ( XREF_FIG ). Moreover, inhibition of the canonical WNT signaling pathway using the siRNA against beta-catenin reduced the expression of miR-150 in the miR-142-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells ( XREF_FIG ). We further confirmed that the inhibition of miR-142 in human breast cancer organoids formed by human BCSCs infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentiviruses decreased the expression of miR-150 ( XREF_FIG ). Taken together, these results indicate that the upregulation of miR-142 induces the expression of miR-150 at least partially through the canonical WNT signaling pathway.\n\n\n\nmiR-142 induces mammary dysplasia and miR-150 induces hyperplasia.\n\nTo clarify the effect of the upregulation of miR-142 and miR-150 on the mammary tissue in vivo, murine mammary epithelial cells were transduced with the lentiviruses expressing miR-142 or miR-150 and the regenerated mammary tissues were histologically analyzed. Expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in the lentivirus infected cells was confirmed by real-time PCR (data not shown). We infected 5 x 10 4  lineage -  murine mammary epithelial cells with the miR-142 or miR-150-expressing lentivirus and transplanted them into the cleared mammary fat pads of syngeneic mice. Non-infected and control lentivirus infected mammary cells were used as controls. Whole mount mammary tissue analyses and histological analyses were performed 8 weeks after transplantation. Transduction of the lentivirus into the mammary transplants was confirmed by the expression of ZsGreen. Overall, 7 out of 12 transplants with non-infected mammary cells and 7 out of 12 transplants with mammary cells infected with control lentivirus formed a mammary tree, suggesting that lentivirus infection was highly efficient and, by itself, did not perturb engraftment of mammary cells. Whole-mount staining and histological analysis of mammary fat pads injected with the control lentivirus-infected mammary cells showed the outgrowth of a normal-looking mammary tree structure consisting of single layers of myoepithelial and luminal cells ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, mammary cells infected with the miR-142 lentivirus formed disorganized structures with multiple layers of cells ( XREF_FIG ). Histological analysis revealed that miR-142-expressing mammary cells formed clusters of cells with an abnormal appearance in which the normal mammary structure was disrupted because of the aberrant cell proliferation ( XREF_FIG ). Mammary cells infected with the miR-150-expressing lentivirus formed a hyperplastic mammary tree with extremely increased branching and thick mammary ducts ( XREF_FIG ). Histological analysis of the mammary trees showed that miR-150-expressing mammary cells formed thick hyperplastic ducts with multiple layers of mammary cells, with scattered small cavities among mammary cell layers ( XREF_FIG ). But unlike miR-142-expressing mammary cells, miR-150-expressing mammary cells had a normal cellular appearance. To confirm that both the dysplastic mammary tissue formed by the miR-142-expressing mammary cells and the hyperplastic mammary tissue formed by the miR-150-expressing mammary cells were both hyperproliferative, we immunostained these tissues with an anti-PCNA antibody. We found that the epithelial cells in the miR-142-expressing and miR-150-expressing mammary tissues were positively stained with an anti-PCNA antibody ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, the mammary tissue regenerated by the control lentivirus transfected mammary cells was rarely stained with an anti-PCNA antibody. The results indicate that the enforced expression of either miR-142 or miR-150 induces hyperproliferation in the mammary tissues and that the phenotype of the miR-142-expressing mammary tissue is more severe and accompanied with abnormal morphology.\n\nNext, we analyzed the expression and localization of beta-catenin in the regenerated mammary tissues. While the signal for the beta-catenin in mammary tissue formed by the control lentivirus-infected mammary cells was weakly detectable and its localization was mostly membranous, we observed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of beta-catenin and the positive staining of active beta-catenin in the dysplastic cell clusters formed by the mammary cells infected with the miR-142-expressing lentivirus ( XREF_FIG ). Although the immunohistochemistry of beta-catenin in general suffers from non-specific staining, we detected nuclear beta-catenin in the miR-142-expressing mammary tissue. We speculate that nuclear beta-catenin was detectable in these immunohistochemistry experiments because the WNT signaling pathway was highly overstimulated in the miR-142-expressing mammary tissue. These results suggest that miR-142 regulates the properties of mammary cells by activating the WNT signaling pathway and conferring the aberrant proliferative ability.\n\n\n\nInhibition of miR-142 suppresses the tumor growth initiated by human BCSCs in vivo.\n\nTo evaluate the role of miR-142 in the growth of human breast cancers initiated by the human BCSCs, we infected human BCSCs isolated from a patient-derived human breast cancer xenograft (PDX) with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus or the control lentivirus. Then, 1 x 10 4  of the infected BCSCs were injected into the mammary fat pad region of the NSG mice. The flow cytometric analyses revealed that 94% and 96% of the human BCSCs were infected with the control or the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus, respectively, 2 days after the infection (data not shown). The growth of the human breast cancer xenografts formed by the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing BCSCs was significantly slower than that of the control human breast cancer xenografts ( XREF_FIG ). We further confirmed that consistent with the results of the human breast cancer cell lines ( XREF_FIG ), the protein level of APC was elevated in the human breast cancer cells isolated from the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing breast cancer xenograft ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that the inhibition of miR-142-3p in human BCSCs from this patient elevated the expression of APC protein and suppressed the proliferation of the breast cancer cells in vivo.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nOur results demonstrate that APC is indeed a relevant target of miR-142. In both normal and malignant mammary cells, miR-142 activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway and regulates proliferation at least in part through upregulation of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling. However, because each miRNA can have hundreds of targets in general, it is likely that other pathways also have roles in the regulation of normal and malignant breast epithelium by miR-142.\n\nExpression of APC protein is modulated by miRNAs, such as miR-135, miR-27, miR-155, and miR-142 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Elevated expression of miR-135, which targets the APC mRNA, has been observed in colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas with/without biallelic APC mutations, suggesting that this miRNA could play a primary or synergistic role in activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway during colon cancer development ( XREF_BIBR ). In a model of osteoblast differentiation, miR-27 and miR-142 were shown to regulate APC expression and to positively modulate the canonical WNT signaling pathway ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). miR-155 targets APC and inhibition of miR-155 using the anti-miR-155 increases the protein level of APC ( XREF_BIBR ). It is noteworthy that both miR-142-3p and miR-155 are more highly expressed in the human BCSCs than in the NTG cells ( XREF_BIBR ). In this study, we show that miR-142 reduced the protein level of APC and enhanced the canonical WNT signaling pathway in normal and malignant mammary epithelium. This is important for the stem cells in the mammary gland ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). The dysregulated WNT signaling can enhance niche independence and promote aberrant proliferation of stem cells. Taken together, upregulation of miR-142, miR-150, and miR-155 may not only be hallmarks of BCSCs but could actually contribute directly to aberrant proliferation of these cells. In this report, we show that miR-150 is a target of miR-142 via its regulation of the canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Notably, miR-150 plays a role in the proliferation induced by miR-142 and the canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Our results suggest that miR-150's regulation of proliferation is downstream of the canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling. In addition, the APC mRNA has a predicted target site for miR-150. We constructed the pGL3 luciferase expression plasmid in which the miR-150 target site within the 3' UTR of the APC mRNA was cloned downstream of a luciferase minigene and found that the activity of this luciferase plasmid was reduced by 32% when the miR-150 precursor was co-transfected (data not shown). However, the results of the Ago IP/microarray experiments revealed that APC mRNA was much less efficiently recruited to RISC by miR-150 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Because each miRNA has multiple target genes, we speculate that the presence of many other target genes with higher affinity to the miR-150-containing RISC will perturb the ability of miR-150 to regulate the APC mRNA and that miR-150 has much weaker effect, if any, on the WNT signaling pathway in vivo.\n\nSome miRNAs are known to be regulated by transcriptional factors which have critical roles in regulating development, proliferation, and cell survival ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). For example, the transcriptional repressors, ZEB1 and ZEB2, which can play a positive role in EMT, suppress transcription of the miR-200a-miR-200b-miR-429 cluster, which in turn represses expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, thereby forming a double negative feedback loop ( XREF_BIBR ). c-Myc enhances expression of the miR-17-92 cluster, which in turn represses E2F1 expression and thereby suppresses cell-cycle entry ( XREF_BIBR ). The tumor suppressor Tp53 regulates expression of miRNAs, including miR-34a, miR-107, and miR-200 ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). Expression of miR-10b, a miRNA that promotes breast cancer cell metastasis by inhibiting HoxD10, is regulated by the transcription factor Twist, a major regulator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( XREF_BIBR ). We identified a TCF/beta-catenin binding site in the promoter region of miR-150 and showed that miR-142 stimulates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in vivo and elevates the expression of miR-150. It has recently been reported that miR-150 induces proliferation and suppresses apoptosis of breast cancer cells ( XREF_BIBR ). A simple model to explain the upregulation of miR-142 and miR-150 in human BCSCs is that suppression of the APC protein expression by miR-142 increases the activity of the canonical WNT signaling pathway and thereby enhances the miR-150 expression. We note that our results show that miR-142 upregulates the expression of miR-150 when miR-142 is highly expressed and/or the WNT signaling pathway is strongly stimulated in mammary epithelial cells. Considering that miR-142 is highly expressed in human BCSCs but weakly expressed or undetectable in the stem/progenitor population of the mammary epithelial cells, our result suggests that the upregulation of miR-142 and the increase of the miR-150 expression by miR-142 could be especially relevant in the initiation and/or progression of human breast cancers driven by human BCSCs in vivo.\n\nThe results of the mouse models suggest that APC dysregulation is associated with initiation and progression of at least some breast cancers. Mice heterozygous for a germline mutation in Apc (Apc +/850T , Apc Min  mice) spontaneously develop mammary tumors, although at significantly lower frequency than intestinal tumors ( XREF_BIBR ). Mice heterozygous for a C-terminal truncation mutation, Apc +/1572T , develop multifocal mammary tumors with pulmonary metastasis at much higher frequency ( XREF_BIBR ). MMTV-promoter-Wnt1 transgenic mice develop breast tumors composed of both luminal and myoepithelial component and expanded mammary stem cell pools ( XREF_BIBR ). Finally, heterozygous mutation of APC in immature, but not mature, mammary epithelium induces breast tumors ( XREF_BIBR ). These results suggest that activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway in mammary epithelium, by mutation of APC, excessive ectopic WNT expression, and/or stabilization of beta-catenin contribute to mammary tumor initiation in the same way as colon cancer at least in mouse models of the mammary tumors. However, although these mouse models that upregulate the canonical WNT signaling activity induce mammary gland tumors ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ), APC mutations are less frequently found in human breast cancers ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ). APC is a key tumor suppressor that regulates the canonical WNT signaling pathway and is involved in development and homeostasis of a variety of cells including stem cells ( XREF_BIBR ). In addition, APC has additional important cellular functions, including roles in cell adhesion, migration, organization of actin and microtubule networks, spindle formation, and chromosome segregation ( XREF_BIBR ). Thus, dysregulation of these processes by mutations in the APC gene is frequently implicated in tumor initiation and progression. Our results show that upregulation of miR-142 can significantly enhance the canonical WNT signaling pathway through the suppression of APC including in the mammary cells. Therefore, miR-142, a miRNA frequently upregulated in human BCSCs than in the NTG cells ( XREF_BIBR ), could provide at least a part of the shared molecular mechanism for aberrant activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway in BCSCs and for the initiation and progression of breast cancers.\n\n",
