      "text":"The Onconeural Antigen cdr2 Is a Novel APC/C Target that Acts in Mitosis to Regulate C-Myc Target Genes in Mammalian Tumor Cells.\n\n\n\nCdr2 is a tumor antigen expressed in a high percentage of breast and ovarian tumors and is the target of a naturally occurring tumor immune response in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, but little is known of its regulation or function in cancer cells. Here we find that cdr2 is cell cycle regulated in tumor cells with protein levels peaking in mitosis. As cells exit mitosis, cdr2 is ubiquitinated by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Previously we showed that cdr2 binds to the oncogene c-myc, and here we extend this observation to show that cdr2 and c-myc interact to synergistically regulate c-myc-dependent transcription during passage through mitosis. Loss of cdr2 leads to functional consequences for dividing cells, as they show aberrant mitotic spindle formation and impaired proliferation. Conversely, cdr2 overexpression is able to drive cell proliferation in tumors. Together, these data indicate that the onconeural antigen cdr2 acts during mitosis in cycling cells, at least in part through interactions with c-myc, to regulate a cascade of actions that may present new targeting opportunities in gynecologic cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nCerebellar-degeneration-related antigen-2 (cdr2) is a target antigen in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), one of several immune-mediated paraneoplastic neurologic degenerations (PND) that develop as a remote effect of systemic cancers  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . In the PNDs, onconeural antigens, which are normally expressed in immune-privileged neurons, become ectopically expressed in tumors. PND patients typically present with neurological symptoms while their associated tumors are usually detected subsequently, a phenomenon believed to relate to tumor immune-suppression  XREF_BIBR . It is believed that after the onset of this appropriate tumor immune response, the immune system becomes competent to target onconeural antigen-expressing neurons.\n\nPCD patients harbor breast or ovarian tumors  XREF_BIBR  that ectopically express cdr2, which is normally made in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and brainstem neurons and testes  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . High titer antibodies reactive with cdr2 are found in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PCD patients and were used to clone several candidate genes  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . The only one of these genes expressed at the protein and RNA level in tumors obtained from PCD patients as well as in Purkinje neurons is cdr2  XREF_BIBR . It is not clear why tumor cells express onconeural antigens, since it appears to put them at risk for immune-mediated destruction. For example, patients with PCD harbor cdr2-specific CD8+ T cells  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . We previously reported that the PCD antigen cdr2 is commonly expressed in gynecologic cancers in more than 50% of ovarian tumors and 22% of breast tumors obtained from the general population of cancer patients  XREF_BIBR . In addition, we have found that cdr2 interacts with c-myc in the cytoplasm of Purkinje neurons and that cdr2 can inhibit c-myc-dependent transcription in tumor cell lines  XREF_BIBR . These observations suggested a possible role for cdr2 in cancer cell biology.\n\nTo explore these observations further, we analyzed cdr2 expression in tumor cells and discovered that it is cell cycle regulated, with protein levels peaking during mitosis. Cdr2 is degraded by the proteasome during mitotic exit by a mechanism that includes recognition and ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). We extend previous observations demonstrating that cdr2 co-localizes and co-precipitates with c-myc in the brain to show that it also does so during mitosis, and that cdr2-mediated modulation of c-myc-dependent transcription is maximal as cells passage through mitosis. Further, we show that cdr2 is required for proper execution of mitosis, as cdr2 knockdown cells have an increased incidence of aberrant mitotic spindles. Cdr2 knockdown cells also exhibit impaired proliferation, while cdr2 overexpression drives proliferation in tumors. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for cdr2 in mitosis in cycling cells, and suggest that this onconeural antigen may play a functional role in gynecologic tumors.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nCdr2 is expressed during mitosis.\n\nWe analyzed cdr2 expression in HEK293 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using PCD patient CSF that specifically recognizes cdr2 and a closely related family member, cdr3  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Only a subset of HEK293 ( XREF_FIG ) cells exhibits high cdr2/3 expression levels. Counterstaining with the nuclear stain DAPI revealed that these cells are in mitosis. Confocal microscopy with a cdr2-specific monoclonal antibody confirmed that cdr2 is expressed in mitotic cells with a diffuse distribution not contiguous with DNA ( XREF_FIG ). We found a similar pattern of staining in cells transduced with retroviral constructs expressing T7-tagged cdr2 ( XREF_FIG ) but not in cells expressing vector alone. Cdr2 protein expression levels appear highest in cells that display a rounded-up appearance typical of mitotic cells ( XREF_FIG ), while neighboring interphase cells exhibit low-level immunoreactivity.\n\nTo directly measure cdr2 protein levels during the cell cycle, we monitored protein levels by Western blot analysis of synchronized cells. We blocked HEK293 cells at G1/S with sequential thymidine and aphidicolin treatment  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , or at metaphase by releasing G1/S-arrested cells into demecolcine ( XREF_FIG ). Cdr2 immunoreactivity was ~23-fold higher during G2/M than at G1/S, compared to a ~12-fold increase in cyclinB1, a protein known to exhibit high expression in mitosis  XREF_BIBR . There was no significant change in the levels of gamma-tubulin, a protein whose levels are not cell cycle regulated ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nTo determine whether changes in cdr2 mRNA levels might contribute to the observed changes in cdr2 protein expression, we harvested RNA from HeLa cells at different time points during the cell cycle and measured cdr2 mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As controls, we measured cyclinB1 mRNA levels, as these are known to decrease after mitotic exit  XREF_BIBR , and beta-actin mRNA levels, as these do not change during the cell cycle  XREF_BIBR . After release from a G2/M block, both cyclinB1 mRNA and cdr2 mRNA levels decreased, with cdr2 levels declining 40% in 12 hours ( XREF_FIG ). We also observed a significant increase in cdr2 mRNA levels in cells released from G1/S blockade prior to entry into mitosis ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The regulation of cdr2 mRNA levels is consistent with the results of two microarray studies, in human primary fibroblasts  XREF_BIBR  and HeLa cells  XREF_BIBR  that screened for cell cycle regulated transcripts. In particular, the HeLa study found that cdr2 mRNA levels peaked in G2 and were 3.4-fold higher during early G2 relative to G1, compared with a 7.3-fold increase in cyclinB1 mRNA. Thus, regulation of steady-state cdr2 mRNA during the cell cycle parallels the rise and fall of cdr2 protein during mitosis, suggesting that de novo translation of cdr2 mRNA contributes to the increase in protein.\n\n\n\ncdr2 protein is targeted for degradation upon mitotic exit.\n\nTo examine whether the high levels of cdr2 in mitosis are subsequently reduced by protein turnover, we assayed whether cdr2 protein was targeted for degradation as cells exit mitosis. HEK293 cells were released from a mitotic block  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  and harvested for Western blot analysis following exit from mitosis. Cdr2 protein levels remain unchanged at 2 hours, but then fell rapidly, such that they were significantly decreased (by ~80%) 8 hours after mitotic release ( XREF_FIG ). CyclinB1 levels also decreased sharply following release from the block  XREF_BIBR , while gamma-tubulin levels remained unchanged under all conditions ( XREF_FIG ). Notably, at the 8-hour time point, faster-migrating cdr2 immunoreactive bands appeared ( XREF_FIG ). We interpreted these bands to be C-terminal cdr2 degradation products as they are detectable in proportion to the decrease in full-length cdr2 levels and were specific to C-terminal cdr2 antibodies. Consistent with the rapid degradation observed during mitotic exit, cdr2 has a short half-life of ~1 hour in HeLa cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These studies were performed using cycloheximide treatments since the lack of a specific cdr2-immunoprecipitating antibody precluded us from performing traditional pulse-chase assays. Taken together, these data indicate that cdr2 is regulated during the cell cycle such that protein expression is high throughout mitosis and is specifically degraded as cells exit mitosis.\n\n\n\ncdr2 ubiquitination and degradation.\n\nTo determine whether cdr2 protein is degraded by the proteasome, we examined the effect of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, on levels of T7cdr2 in HEK293 cells. MG132 treatment for 6 hours led to a 2-fold increase in T7cdr2 protein levels compared to vehicle-treated cells ( XREF_FIG ). To determine whether cdr2 degradation may be ubiquitin-mediated, we transiently co-transfected HEK293 cells with T7cdr2 and HA-ubiquitin expression vectors  XREF_BIBR . We treated asynchronous cells with either vehicle or MG132 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-T7 or control antibodies ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), and assayed immunoprecipitates for HA-immunoreactivity. Anti-HA western blotting ( XREF_FIG ) of control- or MG132-treated inputs confirmed the efficacy of the MG132 in this experiment. In vehicle-treated cells, we observed T7cdr2-ubiquitin conjugates ranging from 75-100 kDa ( XREF_FIG ), while no HA-ubiquitin was detected in control immunoprecipitations. In the presence of MG132, we observed an increase in total immunoprecipitated T7cdr2-ubiqiutin conjugates (data now shown) as well as an increase in the size of the T7cdr2-ubiquitin species which ranged from ~150-275 kDa ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\ncdr2 KEN and destruction boxes are necessary for efficient degradation.\n\nUbiquitin-mediated degradation of mitotic B-type cyclins by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) was first described in budding yeast  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . The APC/C recognizes target proteins harboring sequence elements termed destruction (D) and KEN box motifs  XREF_BIBR . Examination of cdr2 revealed the presence of amino acids matching consensus KEN (KENXXXN/D/E) and D (RXXL) box motifs ( XREF_FIG ) clustered within an 80 amino acid region in the C-terminal half of the protein. The 80 amino acid region containing cdr2's putative KEN and D boxes is highly conserved, with 89% identity among all available mammalian genomes, and 99% identity in mouse, rat, and human. To test whether mutating these sequences altered cdr2 stability in cells exiting mitosis, we compared the steady-state levels of wild type and a mutant form of T7cdr2 (T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2) in which the consensus KEN and D box residues were mutated to alanines ( XREF_FIG ) as such mutations have been shown to abrogate KEN and D box recognition  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . We observed that T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 protein is expressed at 1.8-fold higher levels than wild type T7cdr2 in HEK293 cells four hours following release from a nocodazole block ( XREF_FIG ). In parallel, we performed degradation assays in which we incubated in vitro synthesized  35 S-labeled proteins with an HEK293 extract harvested from cells exiting mitosis. After two hours of incubation, T7cdr2 protein was significantly more degraded than T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 ( XREF_FIG ; 40% degradation for wild type compared to 20% degradation for KEN/D1D2; (p<0.05), while cyclinB1 was degraded at the same rate as T7cdr2.\n\nWe also compared ubiquitination of wild type and T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 in cells exiting mitosis. We observed robust polyubiquitination of wild type T7cdr2 in the absence of any proteasome inhibition ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast to wild type T7cdr2, lower molecular weight (~75KDa) ubiquitin conjugates were evident in T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 mutant extracts, which may correspond to mono- or di-ubiquitinated cdr2 (quantitated by densitometry;  XREF_FIG ). An apparent increase in the overall levels of T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 ubiquitination was parallel to the increase in steady state levels of the T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 protein ( XREF_FIG  and data not shown). Taken together, these data are consistent with enhanced stability of T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 in cells exiting mitosis, and suggest that the cdr2 KEN and D boxes are required for efficient APC/C-mediated polyubiquitination and proteasomal cdr2 degradation in cells exiting mitosis.\n\n\n\nThe APC/C ubiquitinates cdr2 in vitro.\n\nTo directly test whether cdr2 is a target of the APC/C, we immunoprecipitated the APC/C from synchronized HEK293 cells exiting mitosis and incubated the complex with in vitro translated  35 S-T7cdr2. We confirmed the efficacy of the APC/C immunoprecipitation by blotting for three APC/C components: cdc27, cdc23 and APC11 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In the presence of the APC/C, we observed robust ubiquitination of T7cdr2 within 20 minutes (~3 fold over baseline levels), which increased further by 60 minutes (~5 fold), with a reciprocal decrease in full length T7cdr2 as the reaction progressed ( XREF_FIG ). T7cdr2 was not ubiquitinated in the absence of added APC/C. We further demonstrated the specificity of this assay, showing that the APC/C ubiquitinated the canonical substrate cyclinB1, but not an unrelated onconeural antigen, Nova1 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nFrom metaphase until the end of G1, cdc20 and cdh1 sequentially activate the APC/C promoting binding to and ubiquitination of D and KEN box-containing proteins, targeting them for proteasomal degradation (/reviewed in/  XREF_BIBR ). To test whether the APC/C co-activators cdc20 and cdh1 could enhance APC/C-mediated ubiquitination of T7cdr2, immunoprecipitated HACdc20 or HACdh1 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) were added to the in vitro APC/C ubiquitination reaction. We found that addition of either cdc20 or cdh1 enhanced APC-mediated ubiquitination of T7cdr2 by 10-20% ( XREF_FIG ). Consistent with our interpretation that the T7cdr2 KEN/D1D2 mutant is ubiquitinated less efficiently in cells ( XREF_FIG ), we observed that the while the APC/C could still ubiquitinate the KEN/D1D2 mutant in vitro, it did so at reduced levels (data now shown). Taken together, these data indicate that cdr2 levels accumulate upon entry into mitosis and levels are then tightly controlled by turnover during mitotic exit by APC/C-induced polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.\n\n\n\nCdr2 is important for proper spindle formation.\n\nBased on the mitotic-enriched expression and cell cycle regulation of cdr2 we hypothesized the cdr2-deficient HeLa cells may be impaired in the proper execution of mitosis. Consistent with a mitotic role for cdr2, we observed that NCBI's conserved domain database  XREF_BIBR  found significant (p=5x10 -5 ) homology between the cdr2 N-terminal coiled-coil/leucine zipper domain and the coiled-coil regions of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins  XREF_BIBR . While the overall identity between the respective domains is not high, the similarity is and the homology to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic SMC proteins is well conserved in mammalian as well as avian, amphibian and teleost cdr2. To test whether cdr2 may be important in mitosis, we performed cdr2 knockdown utilizing a pool of 4 cdr2-specific siRNAs that reduced cdr2 mRNA or protein levels ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) to less than 10% of control siRNA-treated HeLa cells.\n\nTo examine mitotic cells after cdr2 knockdown, we imaged mitotic spindles in these cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, using a alpha-tubulin antibody and DAPI to visualize mitotic cells. While cdr2 knockdown in HeLa cells did not lead to overt cell cycle arrest ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), we observed an increase in the number of multipolar spindles ( XREF_FIG ). Quantitation of this data revealed that 21% of cdr2 knockdown cells showed aberrant multipolar spindles 48 hours after cdr2 siRNA transfection ( XREF_FIG ), compared to 11% of control cells. We note that our observation of low-level multipolar spindle formation in control siRNA-treated HeLa cells is consistent with previous reports  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR .\n\n\n\ncdr2 interacts with and regulates c-myc during mitosis.\n\nPrevious studies  XREF_BIBR  have shown that cdr2 interacts with c-myc in vivo in the cytoplasm of Purkinje neurons. Cdr2 overexpression can down-regulate c-myc-dependent transcription in tumor cells, although how the cytoplasmic cdr2 protein bound nuclear localized c-myc in this setting was unclear. The observation that cdr2 protein levels peak during mitosis suggested the possibility that it might gain access to c-myc during the breakdown of the nuclear envelope that occurs early in mitosis. To assess whether cdr2 and c-myc colocalize during mitosis, we performed confocal microscopy on HeLa cells. During interphase cdr2 levels were barely detectable and localized to the cytoplasm, while c-myc was localized exclusively to the nucleus ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast during mitosis, cdr2 levels were significantly higher and was co-localized with c-myc protein that had redistributed away from DNA ( XREF_FIG ). High power confocal analyses confirmed the cdr2-c-myc colocalization during mitosis ( XREF_FIG ). While both cdr2 and c-myc displayed diffuse staining patterns that did not overlap with the DAPI signal, we noted that the bulk of the colocalized cdr2 and c-myc preferentially localized proximal to the spindle poles ( XREF_FIG ) consistent with prior observations made on c-myc alone  XREF_BIBR . Following completion of mitosis, c-myc re-localized to the nucleus while cdr2 localized to the cytoplasm ( XREF_FIG ). We previously demonstrated that cdr2 and c-myc co-immunoprecipitated in mouse brain extracts, as well as in tissue culture cells  XREF_BIBR . To test whether cdr2 and c-myc could physically interact during mitosis, we performed co-immunoprecipitations of HeLa cells transiently transfected with tagged cdr2 and c-myc expression constructs. After transfection, we synchronized HeLa cells in G1/S or G2/M and performed either c-myc or control immunoprecipitations followed by western blots to detect cdr2 protein. These experiments ( XREF_FIG ) demonstrated a direct interaction between cdr2 and c-myc is preferentially evident during G2/M-phase, as compared to G1/S, and support the conclusion that cdr2 binds to c-myc when c-myc is not in contact with DNA. The preferential interaction of cdr2 and c-myc during G2/M in this experiment does not appear to be due to elevated levels of endogenous cdr2 protein during G2/M since transfected cdr2 was present at similar levels during G1/S and G2/M in these experiments (data not shown).\n\n\n\ncdr2 regulates c-myc target genes in tumor cells.\n\nWe previously demonstrated that cdr2 could inhibit c-myc-dependent transcription in overexpression experiments  XREF_BIBR . To test whether cdr2 could regulate c-myc target genes, we performed loss-of-function siRNA knockdown studies in HeLa cells. We first tested whether cdr2 knockdown could affect output from a c-myc responsive E-box-luciferase reporter. HeLa cells were transfected with the E-box-luciferase reporter, cdr2 siRNAs or control siRNAs, and an EGFP expression construct for normalization  XREF_BIBR  followed by synchronization at the G1/S border. Following release from a G1/S block, we harvested cells and assayed luciferase activity, and we monitored the cell cycle profile by flow cytometry. We observed a significant spike in E-box-luciferase reporter activity 12 hours after release into S phase, which correlated with the peak of cells in late G2/M ( XREF_FIG , black bars and data not shown), and with a prior report that c-myc-dependent transcription spikes in late G2  XREF_BIBR . Further, we found that cdr2 knockdown led to a decrease in E-box-luciferase reporter activity that was maximal as cell passaged through mitosis ( XREF_FIG ). While the E-box luciferase reporter can also be responsive to transcription factors other than c-myc, this observation led us to further analyze cdr2 regulation of c-myc dependent transcription.\n\nTo assess whether cdr2 could regulate endogenously expressed c-myc target genes in HeLa cells, we compared the transcriptional profile of cells in the presence or absence of cdr2 using siRNA knockdown 3 hours after release from a mitotic block. Because there is a general shutdown of transcription during mitosis  XREF_BIBR , these studies likely reflect a combination of cdr2-dependent changes in target gene expression at G2/M and M/G1 transitions. We identified 324 cdr2-regulated genes whose expression was changed by 1.5 fold or greater ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). A gene ontology analysis of this data set revealed enrichment for genes involved in chromosomal, chromatin and nucleosome regulation as well as in cell cycle and mitotic biology ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nTo assess whether cdr2 could affect c-myc target gene expression, we cross-referenced the 324 cdr2-regulated genes ( XREF_FIG ) with two different c-myc target gene lists, one a comprehensive list of c-myc target genes  XREF_BIBR  (www.myccancergene.org) and the other a list of c-myc target genes identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in HeLa cells  XREF_BIBR . This analysis generated two lists of putative cdr2-regulated c-myc target genes. A Fisher's exact test revealed that the observed degree of overlap was highly significant for both data sets; 44 genes overlapped (p=7.4x10 -11 , odds ratio=3.4) with the c-myc cancer gene database and 31 genes overlapped with the c-Myc ChIP list (p=3.2x10 -7 , odds ratio=3.0). We independently validated changes in the steady state levels of 30/44 (68%) of these transcripts from both lists by qRT-PCR ( XREF_FIG ;  XREF_TABLE ).\n\nTo investigate how cdr2 might be regulating these transcripts, we focused on 15 well-studied genes which are known to be either activated or repressed by c-myc and which have been previously validated (in c-myc null cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation or nuclear run-on experiments;  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). For 13/15 (87%) of these transcripts, cdr2 acted as an agonist of c-myc function ( XREF_TABLE ). In roughly half of these cases, c-myc acts as a transcription inducer and in half a transcription inhibitor, consistent with known actions of c-myc to activate some genes via an E-box, and to repress others, for example, through actions on cell cycle genes through binding to INR sequences  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ).  XREF_FIG  shows examples of c-myc target mRNAs that are either down-regulated or up-regulated in the absence of cdr2.\n\nTo evaluate whether cdr2 action on c-myc target genes was directly dependent on c-myc, we examined the effect of cdr2 knockdown in a Rat-1 c-myc null cell line  XREF_BIBR . We undertook microarray experiments in wild type Rat-1 cells and c-myc-null cells exiting mitosis that were treated with cdr2 or control siRNA pools ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). We identified four genes (CDKN1A, GBP2, INHBA, TGFB2) of the 30 validated cdr2-regulated c-myc target genes in HeLa cells that were also represented on the rat microarray. Microarray and qRT-PCR studies revealed that three of these genes, CDKN1A, GBP2 and TGFB2, are regulated by cdr2 in wild type Rat-1 cells but not in c-myc null cells ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting that these three genes require c-myc to show cdr2 effects on gene regulation. INHBA was not found to be cdr2-regulated in wild type Rat-1 cells.\n\nSeveral validated cdr2-regulated c-myc target genes (CCNB1, CDCA3, CENPA, KIF15, NDC80 and NUF2) are mitosis-related mRNA's ( XREF_TABLE ) that are also down-regulated in the absence of cdr2. Moreover, four of these genes (CENPA, KIF15, NDC80 and NUF2) are involved in kinetochore and spindle biology (reviewed in  XREF_BIBR ). Additionally, cdr2 knockdown lead to a decrease ( XREF_TABLE ) in four other transcripts (AURKA, CENPE, SPC25 and TTK), which are involved in kinetochore and spindle biology, but are not known to be c-myc targets genes ( XREF_BIBR  and reviewed in  XREF_BIBR ). Although our data do not rule out the possibility that cdr2 could have some indirect actions on c-myc target genes, collectively, the data strongly support a model (see Discussion) whereby cdr2 interacts with c-myc during mitosis, but not during other stages of the cell cycle, to promote downstream actions of c-myc on transcriptional targets that mediate effects on mitotic spindle assembly and mitotic passage.\n\n\n\nCdr2 regulates cellular proliferation.\n\nOur findings of a functional interaction between cdr2 and c-myc in mitosis, together with the fact that cdr2 is expressed in gynecologic  XREF_BIBR  and renal  XREF_BIBR  tumors raised the question whether cdr2 can promote tumor growth. Remarkably, several validated cdr2-regulated c-myc target genes in HeLa cells have roles in cell cycle biology ( XREF_TABLE ,  XREF_FIG ). Specifically, of the c-myc target genes that are increased following cdr2 knockdown, several are known to inhibit the cell-cycle (CDKN1A, CDKN2B, and TGFBR2;  XREF_TABLE  and  XREF_BIBR ). These genes are normally repressed by c-myc, as c-myc is promoting the cell cycle and driving proliferation. In contrast, some cell cycle-promoting genes such as CCNB1 and CCND1, which are known to be up-regulated by c-myc, are down-regulated following cdr2 knockdown ( XREF_TABLE ). Taken together, the data form a coherent hypothesis--that cdr2 action on c-myc leads to a concerted action on target genes to promote cellular proliferation, and that this action is inhibited by cdr2 knockdown.\n\nThis hypothesis prompted us to ask whether cdr2 could regulate cellular proliferation. Using  3 H-thymidine incorporation to assay steady state proliferation, we found that cdr2 knockdown led to a 14% (p<0.05) decrease in HeLa cell proliferation ( XREF_FIG ). We obtained similar results (25% reduction, p<0.05) in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line ( XREF_FIG ), which also expresses cdr2  XREF_BIBR . In addition, cdr2 knockdown HeLa cells exhibit delayed kinetics entering into S phase following a G1/S arrest ( XREF_FIG ), with the largest reduction in proliferation observed four hours following release.\n\nBecause cells lacking cdr2 exhibit impaired proliferation, we tested whether cdr2 overexpression could promote cell cycle progression in tumors. We transfected T7cdr2 into EL4 lymphoblastoid cells that have undetectable cdr2 protein levels  XREF_BIBR  in order to generate a stable T7cdr2-expressing clonal cell line (EC2-1), ( XREF_FIG ). When compared to EL4 cells, EC2-1 cells exhibited 1.3-fold higher steady state  3 H-thymidine incorporation ( XREF_FIG ) suggesting that T7cdr2 overexpression may drive the cell cycle. We obtained similar results in both NIH3T3 cells stably over-expressing T7cdr2 and cerebellar granule cell neurons transiently over-expressing T7cdr2 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nTo evaluate whether cdr2 overexpression has growth-promoting activity in vivo, we injected parent EL4 and EC2-1 cells into the flanks of nude mice and monitored tumor growth over the course of two weeks. Importantly, cdr2 expression was maintained in 4 out of the five EC2-1 tumors ( XREF_FIG ) for up to two weeks in the absence of any drug selection. While we did not observe any significant differences in tumor growth rate nor in tumor size ( XREF_FIG ) before animals were sacrificed, the cdr2 positive EC2-1 derived tumors exhibited a significant increase in the number of mitotic figures compared to that of the EL4 cell-derived tumors ( XREF_FIG ). This result is consistent with the elevated proliferation observed in vitro with EC2-1 cells. We also assessed the degree of apoptotic death in these cells, since cells may respond to c-myc over-activation by undergoing programmed cell death  XREF_BIBR . Consistent with our observation that the predominant action of cdr2 was to promote c-myc activity, we observed an increase in the incidence of apoptotic figures ( XREF_FIG ) in the EC2-1 tumors relative to EL4 tumors. While we did not observe that cdr2 promoted c-myc-dependent transcription of apoptotic genes, these data may provide a plausible explanation for why cdr2 overexpression in EC2 cells led to an increase in cell cycling yet EC2-1 tumors were not larger than the control EL4 tumors.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nWe have found that the paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration related antigen cdr2 acts as a mitotic protein in tumor cells. Normally cdr2 expression is mostly restricted within the brain to post-mitotic Purkinje neurons  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR , raising the question of whether its role in mitosis is a novel function of the protein or a reflection of its normal neuronal biology. Many links have been made between the cell cycle machinery and neuronal biology since the discovery of oncogenes--for example, the ras  XREF_BIBR  and myc proteins  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  are expressed in Purkinje neurons, and the cell cycle protein cdk5 is involved in dendrite formation  XREF_BIBR  Thus the evolving idea that cell cycle pathways are utilized for parallel pathways in dividing cells and neurons is supported by the finding here that the Purkinje protein cdr2 functions in mitotic control in tumor cells.\n\nCdr2 levels are regulated in mitosis both by de novo expression of the transcript and protein ( XREF_FIG ), and through down-regulation at least in part by APC/C-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Cdr2 levels are high in brain, raising the question of whether cdr2 is regulated in a similar manner in neurons. The APC/C is active in brain extracts and components of the APC/C (APC2, Cdc27 and Cdh1), are believed to be expressed solely in the nucleus in the cerebellum  XREF_BIBR , while cdr2 is cytoplasmic in Purkinje neurons, suggesting that cdr2 may escape APC/C-mediated ubiquitination. However, recent papers have ascribed axonal and dendritic roles to Cdh1  XREF_BIBR  and Cdc20  XREF_BIBR , respectively, which could have relevance to cdr2, which is present in the neuronal cytoplasm and proximal dendrites  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . More generally, the role we observe for cdr2 in mitosis and spindle formation in dividing cells may reflect a role for cdr2 in Purkinje neuronal dendritic remodeling, as such a role has been proposed for the APC/C Cdc20  in neurons  XREF_BIBR .\n\nOur results also suggest specific consequences for cdr2 mitotic expression in gynecologic cancers, and thereby address the paradox of why these tumors express the cdr2 antigen despite the fact that this allows them to be targeted by the immune system  XREF_BIBR . Mechanistically, APC/C dysfunction in these tumors may play a role; such dysfunction has been proposed to be a hallmark of malignant tumors, as mitotic APC/C substrates were significantly up-regulated in malignant versus non-malignant human cancers in a survey of more than 1600 benign and malignant tumors  XREF_BIBR .\n\nInterestingly, we note that human cdr2 is reported to harbor cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation sites (/PhosphoSitePlus, www.phosphosite.org/ XREF_BIBR ) adjacent to one of its destruction boxes. These sites, serines 309-311, are immediately C-terminal to the second destruction box (RKPL, 303-306aa,  XREF_FIG ), and two of these sites, serines 309 and 311, are phosphorylated in HeLa cells during G1 but not during mitosis  XREF_BIBR . Together with the data presented here and with the proximity of these sites to the destruction box, we suggest a model whereby cdr2 phosphorylation at serines 309-311 might lead to enhanced APC/C-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation during G1, but not during mitosis when these sites are un-phosphorylated and when cdr2 levels are at their peak. Consistent with this model, our previous observation that c-myc preferentially co-immunoprecipitated in vivo with a faster-migrating and possibly unphosphorylated cdr2 species  XREF_BIBR  suggests that the cdr2:c-myc interaction may be favored when cdr2 is un-phosphorylated during mitosis.\n\nWe find that inappropriate expression of cdr2 in tumor cells can impact c-myc activity. The cdr2-c-myc interaction is specific and mediated by the cdr2 leucine zipper/coiled-coil domains  XREF_BIBR . Further, we find that this interaction occurs during mitosis ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_FIG ) and in Rat-1 cells cdr2 acts synergistically with c-myc to regulate endogenous c-myc target genes ( XREF_FIG ). And while CDKN1A's effects in HeLa cells would be expected to be at least partially blocked by the HPV protein E7  XREF_BIBR , we note that the set of cdr2-regulated c-myc target genes in both Rat-1 and HeLa cells ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_TABLE ), including the mitosis-related mRNAs ( XREF_TABLE ), encode proteins important for cell cycle progression. Also, given the recent finding that c-myc controls the expression of two mitotic spindle-associated proteins in breast tumor cell lines  XREF_BIBR , our data that cdr2 may impinge on c-myc regulation of other mitosis-related transcripts during the G2/M transition in HeLa cells is consistent with a role for c-myc during G2  XREF_BIBR . While further experiments are needed to clarify cdr2 function in spindle biology and whether those effects are independent of or connected to cdr2 regulation of c-myc-dependent transcription, these observations suggest a model ( XREF_FIG ) in which cdr2 acts during mitosis, in part through interactions with c-myc, to regulate a cascade of actions related to tumor cell growth.\n\nThese findings have several implications for gynecologic cancer. Cdr2 is not expressed at high levels outside of the brain and testis, but is expressed in 60% of ovarian and 22% of breast tumors and in many transformed cell lines  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Our data suggests that cdr2 may contribute to tumorigenesis, since cdr2 expression levels correlate with cell proliferation. Although we do not see enhanced tumor growth mediated by cdr2 in EL4 tumor cells, a random screen for focus-forming genes in NIH3T3 cells  XREF_BIBR  categorized cdr2 as \"moderately\" oncogenic. It may be that the oncogenic potential of cdr2 can be offset by the ability to trigger apoptotic death, as has been noted for c-myc  XREF_BIBR . Our findings of a function for cdr2 in tumor cell mitosis, together with its normally restricted tissue expression, suggest that it may serve as a tumor target with potential for a high therapeutic index of action.\n\n",
