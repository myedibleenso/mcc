      "text":"Fisetin, a phytochemical, potentiates sorafenib-induced apoptosis and abrogates tumor growth in athymic nude mice implanted with BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.\n\n\n\nMelanoma is the most deadly form of cutaneous malignancy, and its incidence rates are rising worldwide. In melanoma, constitutive activation of the BRAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) signaling pathways plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, survival and tumorigenesis. A combination of compounds that lead to an optimal blockade of these critical signaling pathways may provide an effective strategy for prevention and treatment of melanoma. The phytochemical fisetin is known to possess anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. We found that fisetin treatment inhibited PI3K signaling pathway in melanoma cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of fisetin and sorafenib (an RAF inhibitor) alone and in combination on cell proliferation, apoptosis and tumor growth. Combination treatment (fisetin + sorafenib) more effectively reduced the growth of BRAF-mutated human melanoma cells at lower doses when compared to individual agents. In addition, combination treatment resulted in enhanced (i) apoptosis, (ii) cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, (iii) expression of Bax and Bak, (iv) inhibition of Bcl2 and Mcl-1, and (v) inhibition of expression of PI3K, phosphorylation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, AKT and mTOR. In athymic nude mice subcutaneously implanted with melanoma cells (A375 and SK-MEL-28), we found that combination therapy resulted in greater reduction of tumor growth when compared to individual agents. Furthermore, combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy in: (i) inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis, (ii) induction of apoptosis, and (iii) inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in xenograft tumors. These data suggest that simultaneous inhibition of both these signaling pathways using combination of fisetin and sorafenib may serve as a therapeutic option for the management of melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nIncidence of melanoma, the most aggressive and lethal skin cancer, is rising rapidly worldwide [ XREF_BIBR ]. An estimated 73,870 new cases and 9,940 deaths have been projected to occur in the United States in 2015. Approximately 75% of skin cancer-related deaths are caused by melanoma [ XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, very low survival rates of only 6 to 9 months have been reported in patients after visceral metastasis [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Increased cell proliferation, enhanced cell survival and tumorigenesis are associated with mutational activation of a serine/threonine kinase BRAF in approximately 60% of melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Substitution of valine with glutamic acid at position 600 (V600E) in BRAF results in tremendous increase in BRAF kinase activity leading to constitutive activation of the BRAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ].\n\nSorafenib is an orally active small molecule and multi-kinase modulator that inhibits the serine/threonine kinases CRAF, BRAF (wild type) as well as mutant BRAF V600E  [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that sorafenib inhibits activation of VEGR, PDGFR, FGFR, c-KIT, MET, MAPK and angiogenesis [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Sorafenib also induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in tumor cells harboring BRAF and/or KRAS or NRAS mutations [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Unfortunately, sorafenib demonstrated poor efficacy in melanoma patients when employed as a single agent [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ].\n\nThe PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) signaling pathway, in addition to MAPK, also plays a vital role in the growth, proliferation and survival of melanoma cells [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. The deletion or mutational inactivation of PTEN, which negatively regulates PI3K, has been reported in 10-30% of late-stage melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, the PI3K downstream effector protein AKT has exhibited overexpression in 50-75% of melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ]. Recent studies have shown that the MAPK pathway also cooperates with PTEN-PI3K signaling to enhance cell proliferation, survival and tumor progression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. This evidence suggests that it may be beneficial to target multiple signaling pathways in the treatment of melanoma. Therefore, the combination of RAF inhibitor sorafenib with pharmacologically active agents that target parallel signaling pathways may be a promising strategy to inhibit cell proliferation, survival and tumor progression.\n\nPhytochemicals offer promising potential for the development of more effective strategies for the prevention/treatment of melanoma. Thus, identification of phytochemicals that can be used in combination with lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs is of high clinical relevance. One such agent, fisetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, is found in several fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries, apples, persimmons, grapes, onions and cucumbers. The anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective activities of fisetin have been reported in various studies [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. It has exhibited anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and anti-tumorigenic activities against various cancers by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and NFkappaB signaling pathways [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that fisetin reduces melanoma cell invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition [ XREF_BIBR ]. Murine investigations have also shown that fisetin was rapidly absorbed and detectable in serum [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. To improve the efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of melanoma, we studied combination therapy (fisetin and sorafenib) to evaluate whether fisetin potentiates sorafenib-mediated cell death and tumor growth inhibition. We found that combination treatment effectively inhibited BRAF-mutated melanoma cell growth, induced apoptosis, down-regulated MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. In addition, combination therapy greatly reduced angiogenesis markers in tumors of BRAF-mutated melanoma xenografts.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\nFisetin potentiated sorafenib-mediated inhibition of cell growth, reduction of colony formation and induction of apoptosis in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.\n\nMaintenance of uncontrolled proliferation and survival of malignant cells is the critical step for tumor initiation and progression [ XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, the effects of fisetin on short- and long-term growth of BRAF-mutated A375, SK-MEL-28 and RPMI-7951 melanoma cells were determined by an MTT and colony formation assays. Results of the MTT assay demonstrated that fisetin (10-60muM) treatment significantly decreased the growth of A375 (8.64-61.75%; p < 0.01), SK-MEL-28 (6.94-59.79%; p < 0.01) and RPMI-7951 (11.60-64.11%; p < 0.01) cells in a concentration-dependent manner                    . At low concentrations, fisetin effectively inhibited long-term cell proliferation as shown by dose-dependent decrease in colony number and size                                    . At high concentrations, fisetin induced apoptosis in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells as evidenced by cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, and modulation in Bcl2 family proteins                    . Fisetin also inhibited protein expression of the PI3Kp110alpha and PI3Kp85 subunits and reduced phosphorylation of AKT at Ser 473                     . We also observed that fisetin inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser 2448  and Ser 2481  residues                    . These results illustrate fisetin's abilities to inhibit melanoma cell growth and induce apoptosis by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) signaling pathway.\n\nTo enhance therapeutic potential by simultaneously targeting two different pathways, fisetin was combined with the RAF inhibitor sorafenib. Twenty muM fisetin was combined with 5 and 10muM sorafenib to evaluate the effects of combination-therapy on short-term proliferation. MTT assay results demonstrated a significant reduction in cell growth inhibition (45-56% for A375; 36-48% for SK-MEL-28; and 55-63% for RPMI-7951 cells) in combination treatment groups to that when compared with their respective control.                    . To further explore the observed inhibitory effects exhibited by combinations of fisetin and sorafenib, combination index (CI) values were determined. Values of CI (0.57, 0.814 and 0.507 for A375, SK-MEL-28 and RPMI-7951 respectively for combination of 20muM fisetin and 5muM sorafenib; and 0.44, 0.774 and 0.513 for A375, SK-MEL-28 and RPMI-7951 respectively for combination of 20muM fisetin and 10muM sorafenib) clearly demonstrated that combination treatment exerted synergistic growth inhibition of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells                     . Since therapeutic efficacy of agents depends on long-term effects on cancer cells, we evaluated fisetin in combination with sorafenib on the colony formation abilities of melanoma cells. Results of the clonogenic assay clearly demonstrated that combination treatment effectively inhibited the colony number and size of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells (A375, SK-MEL-28 and RPMI-7951)                                    .\n\nFurthermore, combination treatment (fisetin and sorafenib) was more effective at inducing apoptosis in A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells as compared to individual agents                    . Treatment of A375 cells with 10 and 20muM of fisetin for 48 hrs resulted in 2.5% and 3.5% early apoptotic cell population and 4.8% and 7.4% late apoptotic cell population respectively. Similarly, treatment of A375 cells with 5 and 10muM of sorafenib for 48 hrs resulted in 6.2% and 14.1% early apoptotic cell population and 10.2% and 15.5% late apoptotic cell population respectively. Interestingly, the combination of 20muM fisetin with 5 or 10muM of sorafenib greatly enhanced the apoptotic cell population of A375 cells (25.5% and 16.3% early apoptotic population; 21.5% and 41% late apoptotic population)                    . The observed increase in late apoptotic cell population following combination treatment demonstrated that combination treatment induced apoptosis more rapidly than monotherapy. In addition, fisetin (20muM) potentiated the apoptosis-inducing potential of sorafenib (5 or 10muM) in SK-MEL-28 cells since a higher apoptotic cell population (9.1% and 10.5% early apoptosis; 23.8% and 45.9% late apoptosis) was observed in these combination treatments than 10 and 20muM fisetin (2.1% and 2.8% early apoptosis; 5.3% and 7.1% late apoptosis) and 5 and 10muM sorafenib (1.7% and 5.4% early apoptosis; 7.5% and 14.6% late apoptosis) monotherapy-treated cells                    . These results clearly demonstrated that fisetin potentiates sorafenib-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and augments cell death by facilitating apoptosis.\n\n\n\nFisetin enhanced sorafenib-mediated cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and modulated expression of Bcl2 family proteins in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.\n\nSince higher concentrations of fisetin induced apoptosis in melanoma cells                    , we next examined the effects of fisetin in combination with sorafenib at lower concentrations on activation of caspase-3, cleavage of PARP and expression of Bcl2 family proteins in melanoma cells. As shown in Figure  XREF_FIG , the treatment of A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells with either 20muM fisetin or 5muM sorafenib demonstrated modest effects on activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. However, when these two agents were combined the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was greatly enhanced in both the cell lines. While monotherapy also exhibited modest effects on expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Mcl-1, combination treatment more effectively reduced expression of these survival proteins. In addition, the combination was more effective at inducing expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak as compared to individual agents                    .\n\n\n\nFisetin in combination with sorafenib effectively down-regulated MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.\n\nConstitutive activation of MAPK signaling in melanoma is associated with increased cell proliferation, survival and tumor progression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Studies have demonstrated that activated BRAF in the MAPK signal transduction pathway propagates signals by phosphorylating MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, we investigated the effects of fisetin and sorafenib alone and in combination on MAPK signaling pathway. We found that combination treatment more effectively reduced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells than individual agents                    . In BRAF-mutated melanoma, the MAPK pathway cooperates with PI3K signaling to promote melanoma initiation and progression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Activation of PI3K signaling that regulates cell proliferation, survival and progression of tumor is a common genetic event in melanomas. The elevated PI3K signaling correlates with progression of tumors and has been observed in metastatic melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. PI3K/AKT-mediated activation of the downstream target mTOR results in cell proliferation and survival by regulating the translation of proteins involved in tumor progression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, the effect of fisetin in combination with sorafenib on the PI3K signaling pathway was evaluated in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that combination treatment significantly reduced the protein expression of PI3K (catalytic subunit p110alpha and phosphorylation of AKT at Ser 473                     . Furthermore, loss of functional PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, has been reported in more than half of all melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ]. Since BRAF mutation and concurrent down-regulation (reduced expression or loss of function) of PTEN is common in melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ], we also quantified PTEN expression in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells following combination treatment. We observed that expression of PTEN was greatly enhanced in combination treated cells as compared to cells treated with individual agents                    . In addition, combination therapy greatly reduced the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser 2448  as compared to individual agents                    .\n\n\n\nFisetin potentiated the sorafenib-mediated tumor growth inhibition of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in athymic nude mice.\n\nWe next determined the effects of fisetin, sorafenib and their combination on an in vivo xenograft mouse model subcutaneously implanted with BRAF-mutated A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells. The athymic nude mice implanted with melanoma cells were treated with fisetin (45 mg/kg body wt.), sorafenib (45 mg/kg body wt.) and a combination orally three times per week. The combination of fisetin and sorafenib showed significant higher tumor growth inhibition than the individual agents. Average tumor volume in mice injected with A375 cells and treated with vehicle was 1124.12 mm 3 ; whereas in fisetin, sorafenib and combination treated groups, average tumor volume was 716.12, 602.50 and 224.03 mm 3  respectively. This significant decrease indicated 36.29% (p < 0.01), 46.40% (p < 0.01) and 80.07% (p < 0.001) reduction in tumor growth respectively                    . The growth inhibitory effects observed in combination group were significantly higher (p < 0.001 versus fisetin and p < 0.01 versus sorafenib) compared to monotherapy groups. In SK-MEL-28 cell-inoculated mice, the average tumor volume in the control group was 1265.69 mm 3 ; whereas the fisetin, sorafenib and combination groups, averaged tumor volumes of 761.15, 552.02 and 15.93 mm 3  respectively. This significant decrease indicated 39.86% (p < 0.01), 56.38% (p < 0.01) and 98.74% (p < 0.001) reduction in tumor growth respectively                    . These results demonstrate that combination treatment inhibited tumor growth (p < 0.001 versus fisetin and p < 0.01 versus sorafenib) significantly higher than the fisetin and sorafenib montherapy groups.\n\nBased on the results of our in vitro and in vivo growth inhibition studies, we hypothesized that a synergistic reduction in cell growth and induction of apoptosis with fisetin and sorafenib in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells might also abrogate growth of established tumors. Therefore treatment of mice was started when the tumor size reached ~200 mm 3  and terminated when tumor size reached ~1200 mm 3  in the control group. Monotherapy treatment (fisetin or sorafenib alone) of mice bearing A375 xenograft tumors resulted in substantial tumor growth reduction (18.88% and 28.16%) with 1022.54 and 905.53 mm 3  respective tumor volumes when compared to control 1260.56 mm 3 . Combination treatment was highly effective in reducing tumor growth (56.65%; p < 0.01) as compared to the control group with tumor size of 546.36 mm 3  only                    . Furthermore, this effect was also significant (p < 0.05) when compared with fisetin or sorafenib alone. Similarly, the treatment of SK-MEL-28 tumor bearing mice with fisetin or sorafenib alone produced a significant tumor growth inhibition (32.56% and 40.55%; p < 0.05) with 844.59 and 744.41 mm 3  tumor volume when compared with 1252.36 mm 3  tumor of the control group. Combination of fisetin and sorafenib treatment produced highly significant tumor growth inhibition (66.43%; p < 0.01) with tumor volume of 420.37 mm 3  only as compared to the control group. This effect was also significant (p < 0.05) when compared with tumor growth inhibitory effects of monotherapy                    . These results clearly demonstrated that in vitro growth inhibitory effect of fisetin when combined with sorafenib was significantly translated under in vivo conditions.\n\n\n\nFisetin augmented sorafenib-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation markers in xenograft tumors.\n\nNext, we examined the expression of molecules associated with cell proliferation in tumors of nude mice subcutaneously injected with BRAF mutated A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells following treatment with fisetin, sorafenib and the combination. Results from immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections demonstrated a decreased intensity-staining pattern of cell proliferation markers such as PCNA, Ki67 and cyclin D1 in fisetin and sorafenib treated tumors as compared to their respective untreated control groups. Furthermore, this reduction was more pronounced in combination treatment                                   .\n\n\n\nFisetin enhanced sorafenib-mediated apoptosis in xenograft tumors.\n\nSince fisetin enhanced the apoptosis-inducing potential of sorafenib in vitro, tumor sections and lysates were also evaluated for apoptosis. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses demonstrated that fisetin and sorafenib alone induced apoptosis in xenograft tumors. Combination therapy more effectively cleaved caspase-3 and PARP in xenograft tumors compared to individual agents                                   . In addition, Western blot analysis also revealed that combination treatment resulted in a greater decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 with a concomitant increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax as compared to individual agents                    .\n\n\n\nFisetin potentiated sorafenib-mediated downregulation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling in xenograft tumors.\n\nSince results of in vitro and in vivo growth inhibition demonstrated that the combination of fisetin and sorafenib is highly effective in inducing apoptosis and reducing the tumor growth as compared to single agents, we examined the effects of these treatments on the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. Combination treatment was more effective in reducing the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 than either fisetin or sorafenib alone                                   . Immunoblot analysis of tumor lysates revealed that the combination of fisetin and sorafenib further reduced expression of PI3K, enhanced PTEN expression, and decreased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR as compared to monotherapy                                   .\n\n\n\nFisetin potentiated anti-angiogenic effects of sorafenib in xenograft tumors.\n\nSince tumors maintain their growth and survival by developing new blood vessels, agents targeting angiogenesis have shown promising anticancer potential. The combination of fisetin and sorafenib significantly inhibited melanoma cell growth, induced apoptosis and down-regulated cell survival signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. An accumulating body of evidence has shown that agents targeting MAPK or PI3K signaling cascade also inhibit angiogenesis [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Since combination treatment more effectively reduced MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways in xenograft tumors, we next determined the effects of combination therapy on angiogenesis in xenograft tumors. Figure  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG  illustrate our findings that combination treatment was more effective in reducing the markers of angiogenesis (CD31 and VEGF) in tumors than monotherapy.\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nIn spite of exerting significant anti-cancer properties in various preclinical models, sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets MAPK signaling pathway, failed to translate its potential in melanoma patients due to limited efficacy against metastatic melanoma [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, patients treated with sorafenib exhibited considerable serious side-effects [ XREF_BIBR ]. Although acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors treatment is known to involve reactivation of MAPK signaling, an accumulating body of evidence suggests that activation of PI3K signaling also contributes to intrinsic cascades involved in melanoma development and progression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, it may be necessary to simultaneously target both pathways in the treatment of melanoma. In the present investigation, the non-toxic flavonoid fisetin has shown potential to inhibit melanoma cell growth and induce apoptosis of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells by reducing PI3K signaling. Therefore, fisetin was combined with sorafenib to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Our results demonstrated that the simultaneous targeting of these two parallel cell survival signaling pathways with fisetin and sorafenib resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition, increased apoptosis and greater reduction in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the low-dose fisetin and sorafenib combination worked synergistically to inhibit melanoma cell growth and abrogate colony formation.\n\nEvasion of apoptosis due to intrinsic or acquired resistance is one of the hallmarks of cancers resulting in tumor development and progression [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. The induction of apoptosis in cancer cells has been the center of traditional cancer chemotherapy and targeted therapy for many years [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that sorafenib induces apoptosis in melanoma cells by activating pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad, Bak and Bax), down-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl2, Bcl-Xl and Mcl-1) and inducing PARP cleavage [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Our data demonstrated that fisetin also induces apoptosis in melanoma cells by cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, and modulation of expression of the Bcl2 family of proteins in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. When fisetin was combined with sorafenib, fisetin further augmented the apoptosis-inducing potential of sorafenib in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. Several studies have clearly demonstrated that the MAPK and PI3K pathways intersect at multiple levels [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Constitutive activation of AKT protects cells from BRAF inhibitors, and detection of elevated AKT phosphorylation in BRAF-inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells suggests that enhanced AKT levels are associated with BRAF-inhibitor-ineffectiveness [ XREF_BIBR ]. Activated AKT inhibits apoptosis by inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins and cleavage of caspases. Furthermore, stability of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 in melanoma cells is regulated by ERK1/2, and enhanced expression of this protein in melanoma cells has demonstrated resistance against BRAF inhibitor-induced apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Evidence suggests that ERK1/2 inhibition alone remains insufficient due to reprieve of ERK1/2-dependent negative feedback activation of RAS and PI3K signaling [ XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, successful inhibition of MAPK will require co-inhibition of PI3K and other alternative cell survival pathways. In the present investigation, we found that fisetin inhibited expression of PI3K and enhanced expression of PTEN as well as decreased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. When fisetin was combined with sorafenib, co-targeting of these two parallel signaling pathways resulted in enhanced apoptosis in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. In addition, fisetin alone reduced the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in these cells. When combined with sorafenib, fisetin further potentiated the reduction in phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Furthermore, combination treatment also resulted in greater down-regulation of PI3K expression, and phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR as compared to fisetin or sorafenib alone. Fisetin also potentiated restoration of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K signaling that cooperates with MAPK signaling in melanoma.\n\nMore importantly, the in vitro effects of fisetin were translated under in vivo conditions. The addition of fisetin potentiated the antitumor activity of sorafenib against growing as well as pre-existing melanoma xenograft tumors. The BRAF mutation in melanoma drives enhanced proliferation through MAPK-induced expression of cyclin D1 and mediates BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma cells [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, PI3K signaling also regulates cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation [ XREF_BIBR ]. Like sorafenib, oral administration of fisetin monotherapy significantly inhibited the tumor growth of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in nude mice by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation markers (PCNA, Ki67 and cyclin D1). Fisetin significantly inhibited tumor growth through induction of apoptosis by activating cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP proteins, and modulating expression of Bcl2 family proteins. In the present investigation, combination (fisetin and sorafenib) treatment produced a greater reduction in cell proliferation markers than either agent alone. Moreover, fisetin significantly potentiated sorafenib's antitumor activity and apoptosis-inducing potential by further reducing MAPK and PI3K signaling.\n\nMounting evidence suggests that the formation of new blood vessels is a prominent feature among melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Increased VEGF protein expression and accumulation in the tumor stroma has been associated with the transition of radial to vertical growth phase in melanoma [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Several studies have demonstrated that mutant BRAF regulates secretion of pro-angiogenic factors, enhances growth and increases the development of vasculature in melanoma tumors [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Studies have shown that sorafenib inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF production and MAPK signaling in endothelial cells [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling also plays an important role in angiogenesis regulation in various cancers by increasing VEGF production in endothelial cells as well as in cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, fisetin likely augmented sorafenib's anti-angiogenic properties in melanoma tumors by inhibiting PI3K pathway.\n\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate fisetin's ability to potentiate the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-tumor effects of sorafenib. This phytochemical may be a worthy, minimally-toxic adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent drug resistance and improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-melanoma drugs in the future. Translational studies are the next steps to gauge the potential impact of these findings in humans.\n\n",
