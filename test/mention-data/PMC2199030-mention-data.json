      "text":"Src Homology 2 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (SHPTP2)/Src  Homology 2 Phosphatase 2 (SHP2) Tyrosine Phosphatase Is a  Positive Regulator of the Interleukin 5 Receptor Signal  Transduction Pathways Leading to the Prolongation of  Eosinophil Survival .\n\n\n\nInterleukin-5 (IL-5) regulates the growth and function of eosinophils. It induces rapid tyrosine  phosphorylation of Lyn and Jak2 tyrosine kinases. The role of tyrosine phosphatases in IL-5  signal transduction has not been investigated. In this study, we provide first evidence that SH2  protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHPTP2) phosphotyrosine phosphatase plays a key role in prevention of eosinophil death by IL-5. We found that IL-5 produced a rapid activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2 within 1 min. The tyrosine phosphorylated SHPTP2 was  complexed with the adapter protein Grb2 in IL-5-stimulated eosinophils. Furthermore,  SHPTP2 appeared to physically associate with beta common (beta c ) chain of the IL-5 receptor (IL-5beta c R). The association of SHPTP2 with IL-5beta c R was reconstituted using a synthetic phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, beta c  605-624, encompassing tyrosine (Y) 612 . The binding to the  phosphotyrosine-containing peptide increased the phosphatase activity of SHPTP2, whereas  the same peptide with the phosphorylated Y 612 --> F mutation did not activate SHPTP2. Only  SHPTP2 antisense oligonucleotides, but not sense SHPTP2, could inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein kinase, and reverse the eosinophil survival advantage  provided by IL-5. Therefore, we conclude that the physical association of SHPTP2 with the  phosphorylated beta c  receptor and Grb2 and its early activation are required for the coupling of  the receptor to the Ras signaling pathway and for prevention of eosinophil death by IL-5.\n\n\n\nEosinophils play an integral role in the pathogenesis of  allergic and parasitic disorders ( XREF_BIBR ). IL-5 is a cytokine  that primarily promotes the differentiation of eosinophils  from the stem cells and stimulates the survival and function  of mature eosinophils ( XREF_BIBR ). This diverse effect of IL-5 on  eosinophils has been proposed as the key mechanism for  the development of blood and tissue eosinophilia in the  course of allergic inflammation.\n\nIL-5R is a member of the hematopoietic receptor superfamily and is composed of a ligand-specific alpha subunit and  shared with IL-3 and GM-CSF beta common (beta c ) subunit  ( XREF_BIBR ). Although neither of the receptor subunits contain a kinase-like catalytic domain, IL-5 does induce a rapid and reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins ( XREF_BIBR ). Recent findings indicate that for IL-5R type, the  binding of the ligand results in the activation of cytoplasmic  tyrosine kinases of the Jak/Tyk and Src type families ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ).  Indeed, we have shown that the stimulation of eosinophils  with IL-5 results in phosphorylation and activation of the  receptor-bound Lyn and Jak2 kinases. The consequence of  activation of these tyrosine kinases is the propagation of signal through the ras-raf-1-MEK-MAP (MAP, microtubule-associated protein, MEK, MAP or Erk kinase) kinase pathway and the Jak-STAT pathway. These observations clearly  support a major role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in  IL-5-mediated signaling.\n\nLittle is known about the function of protein tyrosine  phosphatases (PTPs) 1  in the signaling process initiated by the  receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The PTP  Src homology (SH)PTP2, recently designated Src homology 2 phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and also called PTP1D or Syp,  is one member of a small family of Src homology 2 (SH2)  domain-containing PTPs, which also includes Corkscrew  (Csw) and PTP-1C (also called SH-PTP1 or HCP) ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ).  SHPTP2 contains two SH2 domains and a single catalytic  domain. This phosphatase is ubiquitously expressed and  found to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response  to erythropoietin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),  prolactin, IL-3, and GM-CSF ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). Upon specific stimulation, SHPTP2 binds to the receptor for PDGF and Epo.  Once phosphorylated on tyrosine, SHPTP2 generates a  binding site for the adapter protein, Grb2, which in turn  may lead to activation of the Ras-signaling pathway ( XREF_BIBR ,   XREF_BIBR ). Although it has been postulated that PTPs function as  the negative regulators of the signal generated by protein  tyrosine kinases, several recent studies show that the inactivation of SHPTP2 leads to a decrease in mitogenesis in response to epidermal growth factor, PDGF, and insulin, indicating that this phosphatase may, in some instances, act as  a positive signal transmitter ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ).\n\nThe role of SHPTP2 in the IL-5 signal transduction in  eosinophils has not been investigated. In this study we investigated the phosphorylation state, association with other  proteins, and catalytic activity of this phosphatase after triggering of the IL-5R. Furthermore, using specific antisense  oligodeoxynucleotides, we investigated the role of SHPTP2  in IL-5-mediated prolongation of eosinophil survival.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nActivation of SHPTP2..\n\nIt has been reported that the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2 is associated with its increased phosphatase activity ( XREF_BIBR ). Therefore, we first tested  whether IL-5 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2.  In this analysis, eosinophils were stimulated with IL-5 for  various time periods and then lysed and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-SHPTP2 antibody. Western  blotting with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody revealed phosphorylation of SHPTP2 as early as 1 min, reaching the highest level 5 min after the stimulation                  . This suggests a  relatively early involvement of SHPTP2 in the IL-5 signaling pathway. Reprobing the membrane with the anti-SHPTP2 antibody confirmed the presence of equal amounts  of the immunoprecipitated protein. \n\nNext, we assessed whether IL-5 stimulated the enzymatic activity of SHPTP2. SHPTP2 was immunoprecipitated from control or IL-5-treated eosinophils, and the  phosphatase activity was measured. The results are shown  in Fig.  XREF_FIG . The kinetics of phosphatase bioactivity was similar to the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation, reaching the  peak in 5 min. A significant activity was detectable as late as  30 min after stimulation. A two- to threefold increase in  phosphatase activity was consistently observed in three independent experiments. \n\n\n\nPhysical Association with Grb2..\n\nOnce phosphorylated on  tyrosine, SHPTP2 conforms to the consensus binding site,  pYXNX, for the SH2 domain of Grb2 adapter protein  ( XREF_BIBR ). Since the binding of Grb2 to SHPTP2 might explain  Ras activation after IL-5 stimulation, we asked whether  SHPTP2 could bind Grb2 in stimulated eosinophils. To  analyze the interaction between SHPTP2 and Grb2, first  we performed immunoprecipitation of Grb2 from IL-5- stimulated and control cells followed by immunoblotting  with antiphosphotyrosine and anti-SHPTP2 antibodies.\n\nAs shown in Fig.  XREF_FIG  A, we detected a band of a 70-kD tyrosine phosphorylated protein in the immunoprecipitate of  Grb2 from IL-5-stimulated cells. Reprobing the same  membrane with the anti-SHPTP2 antibody confirmed the  presence of SHPTP2 in immunoprecipitate of Grb2                     . In a next set of experiments, we looked for the presence of Grb2 in the immunoprecipitates of SHPTP2. As  shown in Fig.  XREF_FIG  B, Grb2 was detectable in the anti-SHPTP2 immunoprecipitates and predictably, in the anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitate from IL-5-stimulated eosinophils.  These experiments suggest a physical association of SHPTP2  and Grb2 that occurs in an IL-5-dependent manner. \n\n\n\nPhysical Association with IL-5beta c R..\n\nThe next set of coimmunoprecipitation experiments was carried out to investigate the physical association of SHPTP2 with IL-5beta c R. For  this purpose, eosinophil lysates were immunoprecipitated  with anti-SHPTP2 antibody and immunoblotted with antireceptor IL-5beta c  antibody. We found the presence of IL-5beta c R  in immunoprecipitate of SHPTP2 obtained from IL-5-stimulated cells                    . In the next set of experiments we  looked for the presence of SHPTP2 in immunoprecipitates  of IL-5beta c R. Western blotting with anti-SHPTP2 antibody  revealed the presence of the phosphatase in immunoprecipitate of IL-5beta c R                    . The association between SHPTP2  and receptor appears to be present only in stimulated eosinophils. \n\nThe binding of SHPTP2 with IL-5beta c R only in stimulated cells suggests that the physical association occurs through  the SH2 domains of SHPTP2. The SH2 domain of SHPTP2  is predicted to bind to a consensus sequence of SXXpYXXL ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). The beta c  subunit of IL-5R has seven tyrosine residues in cytosolic region and one of the tyrosine  residues at position 612 conforms best to the tyrosine binding motif of protein tyrosine phosphatases. We synthesized  a tyrosine phosphorylated (pY 612 ) peptide encompassing  the residues 605-624 of IL-5beta c R. Two peptides served as  controls. The first control peptide had the same sequence  except the replacement of pY 612  with F. Since SH2 domain  binds to phosphorylated Y and not to nonphosphorylated  Y residues, we used a second control peptide, beta c 450-465  that contained two nonphosphorylated Y residues. All peptides were biotinylated. For peptide binding experiments,  we used lysates from HL-60 cells instead of eosinophils.  HL-60 cells constitutively express SHPTP2 and served as a  readily available source of the phosphatase. The peptides  were incubated with HL-60 cell lysates and the precipitated  proteins were blotted with anti-SHPTP2 antibody. As  shown in Fig.  XREF_FIG , only the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide bound SHPTP2. This experiment shows that the  phosphorylated beta receptor can directly bind to SHPTP2  phosphatase. \n\nTo examine the potential effect of the IL-5beta c R binding  to SHPTP2, we asked whether addition of the phosphopeptide, beta c  605-624 affected SHPTP2 activity. SHPTP2  activity was assayed in the absence or presence of the phosphopeptide. The mutated peptide was used as the control.  The addition of the phosphopeptide beta c  605-624 strongly  stimulated SHPTP2 activity by more than fivefold                    suggesting that binding of the phosphatase alone is responsible for its activation. The mutated beta c  605-624 peptide  did not activate the phosphatase. \n\n\n\nSurvival of Eosinophils Treated with SHPTP2 Antisense  ODNs..\n\nSince eosinophils are terminally differentiated  cells with life spans of ~4 d, the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides is the most practical method to specifically alter expression of SHPTP2. Eosinophils were incubated  with ODNs without FCS to protect stability of ODNs. As  demonstrated in Fig.  XREF_FIG , eosinophils exposed to 7.5 muM  antisense ODN for 6 h expressed little or no detectable  SHPTP2, whereas sense or nonsense ODNs did not alter  SHPTP2 level. Antisense ODNs used in our assay did not  alter expression of a closely related phosphatase SHPTP1  (data not shown). The viability of eosinophils assessed at  this time (immediately before stimulation with IL-5) always  exceeded 90% and was not different from control samples,  indicating that at concentration of 7.5 muM the ODNs were  not toxic to the cells. After 2 h of stimulation, eosinophils  were resuspended in medium without IL-5, ODNs, and  FCS. We excluded FCS from this stage of experiment,  since in a previous study by Inhorn et al., serum appeared  to alleviate the requirement for the Ras pathway for GM-CSF-dependent viability and proliferation in mutant cells  with beta receptor lacking the 626-763 amino acid residues  ( XREF_BIBR ). Viability of the cells cultured without serum was always higher than 55% as assessed 24 h after stimulation with  IL-5. In contrast to IL-5-stimulated cells, there was usually  <40% viable control (not treated with IL-5) eosinophils at  the same time. However, as shown in Fig.  XREF_FIG , SHPTP2 antisense oligonucleotides blocked the ability of IL-5 to prevent eosinophil death (35.0 +/- 6.8 versus 66.2 +/- 8.0 versus  60.2 +/- 5.4% for antisense, sense, and nonsense ODN- treated cells, respectively, P <0.05) indicating critical role  of SHPTP2 phosphatase in IL-5-induced survival of eosinophils.  \n\nNext we addressed the question of requirements of  SHPTP2 phosphatase in IL-5-induced phosphorylation of  MAP/Erk2 kinase. As shown in Fig.  XREF_FIG , there was significant reduction in MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation in  eosinophils that were treated with the antisense ODNs. Since  MAP kinase is considered a downstream molecule of the  Ras signaling pathway, these results suggest that SHPTP2  plays a positive role in IL-5-induced activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. \n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nPreviously, we have demonstrated that IL-5 stimulates  the phosphorylation and activation of the receptor-bound  tyrosine kinases in eosinophils. In this report, we show that  the IL-5 stimulation results in the phosphorylation and activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHPTP2. Others  have reported the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2 in  IL-3 and GM-CSF-stimulated murine myeloid cell lines ( XREF_BIBR ).  Our data extend these findings by showing that SHPTP2  binds to the beta c  chain of the IL-5R in human eosinophils.  In additional studies, we have demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylated beta c  605-624 peptide encompassing  pY 612  binds and activates SHPTP2. There was no binding  of SHPTP2 to the same peptide when phosphotyrosine  (pY 612 ) was replaced with phenylalanine. This is the first  evidence that SHPTP2 directly interacts with the native  fragment of beta c  chain of IL-5R. Finally, we demonstrate the  requirement of the SHPTP2 for IL-5-induced phosphorylation of MAP/Erk2 kinase and prolongation of eosinophil  survival.\n\nSpecific domains within the beta c  receptor may contain information necessary to initiate distinct events such as proliferation or differentiation through propagation of distinct  signaling pathways. Previous studies using a series of truncated mutants revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of beta c   contained two functional regions required for signaling ( XREF_BIBR ).  The membrane proximal region (amino acid residues 456- 517) was shown to be essential for proliferation, activation  of Jak2 and pim-1, and induction of c-myc. A second domain (amino acid residues 627-763) was found to be necessary for activation of Shc, p21 Ras, Raf-1, and MAP kinase  as well as for induction of c-fos and c-jun. It is noteworthy  that site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 750 to phenylalanine revealed a viability defect of mutated cells comparable  to deletion of the entire 627-763 domain ( XREF_BIBR ). In a recent  work, Itoh et al. attempted to find the functional region of  the beta c  responsible for activation of Ras and induction of  c-fos promoter ( XREF_BIBR ). They found that GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of two signaling molecules, Shc and  SHPTP2, functioning in Ras activation. As tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was abrogated by the single substitution  at Y 577  of the full-length beta c  receptor, Y 577  has an essential  role in Shc activation. In contrast to Shc, both beta589 truncated and beta wild with Y 577 --> F mutation, were capable of  inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2, indicating  that activation of the phosphatase is mediated by multiple  sites, including Y 577  as well as by other functional sites located COOH-terminal to amino acid 589.\n\nIn our study, we found that beta c  coprecipitates with  SHPTP2, suggesting that physical association of these molecules occurs in IL-5-stimulated eosinophils. The direct association of SHPTP2 and beta c  seems reasonable since the  synthetic 20-mer peptide, beta c 605-624 containing a phosphorylated tyrosine (Y 612 ), was able to bind SHPTP2. However, the exact binding site for SHPTP2 on beta c  receptor remains to be clarified. There are four tyrosine residues (Y 612 ,  Y 750 , Y 806 , and Y 869 ) located COOH-terminal to amino acid  589 on beta c  receptor surrounded by amino acid residues partially matching a consensus sequence of Y(I/V)Xaa(V/I/L/P)  that favors the binding of the NH 2 -terminal SH2 domain  of SHPTP2 ( XREF_BIBR ). We speculate that Y 612  and/or Y 750  are  likely binding sites for SHPTP2, since the sequence surrounding Y 612  and Y 750  human IL-5beta c R conform to the  so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif  (ITIM) sequence motif of (T/S)XX(pY)XXL ( XREF_BIBR ). Synthetic phosphopeptides representing the ITIM sequence have  been shown to bind tyrosine phosphatases SHPTP1 and  SHPTP2 and, what is of much interest, this binding results  in dramatic increase in their phosphatase activity ( XREF_BIBR ). Indeed, we have shown that addition of a phosphotyrosine  peptide comprising the region around pY 612  stimulates  SHPTP2 activity four- to sixfold, whereas the nonphosphorylated peptide has no stimulatory effect. The phosphorylated beta c  612-624 reported here is the first native peptide derived from beta c  that potently stimulates SHPTP2  phosphatase activity.\n\nThe current model of the IL-5/IL-3/GM-CSF signaling  pathway predicts that the stimulation of the receptor by the  ligand causes the activation of the receptor bound tyrosine  kinases. The activated tyrosine kinases then tyrosine phosphorylate beta c  receptor. Tyrosine kinases bound to box 1  (W 458 -P 465 ) are likely to be responsible for this event, since  deletion of this motif results in loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of beta c  ( XREF_BIBR ). Indeed, in mutant cells lacking Jak2 kinase, there was no phosphorylation of beta c  in response to  GM-CSF. Moreover, these cells failed to phosphorylate  SHPTP2 ( XREF_BIBR ). We believe that one of the phosphorylated  tyrosines on beta c  creates the binding site for the SH2 domain  of SHPTP2. It is possible that SHPTP2 binds to more than  one phosphorylated tyrosine residue, and which one is critical for SHPTP2 activation remains to be determined. The  occupancy of SH2 domains results in an increase in phosphatase activity, presumably due to the induction of conformational changes in SHPTP2 ( XREF_BIBR ). The role of increased  phosphatase activity of SHPTP2, as well as its target molecule remains unclear. One possible target for activated  SHPTP2 phosphatase is beta c . Upon beta c  binding, activated  SHPTP2 might attenuate the beta c  signal by dephosphorylating the receptor, receptor-associated proteins, or itself. However, the observation that SHPTP2 remains associated with  the phosphorylated IL-5beta c R might argue against this model.  We did not observe dephosphorylation of beta c , SHPTP2,  Jak2, and Lyn immunoprecipitated from IL-5-stimulated  cells at the time of maximal activation of SHPTP2 (data  not shown). An alternative possibility is that SHPTP2 acts  as a positive signal transducer by dephosphorylating inhibitory phosphotyrosine residues. Although we did not observe inhibition of Lyn and Jak2 phosphorylation in eosinophils lacking SHPTP2 phosphatase, we cannot exclude  other tyrosine kinases as a target of the phosphatase. Feng  et al. showed that SHPTP2 becomes constitutively tyrosine  phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells ( XREF_BIBR ). The authors  suggested that SHPTP2 might dephosphorylate c-src on  Tyr 527 , whose phosphorylation blocks tyrosine kinase activity. IL-5 has been shown to activate several tyrosine kinases  including members of Src kinases family Lyn and Fyn and  tyrosine kinase Syk ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Moreover, SHPTP2 and beta c   have been shown to coprecipitate with PI-3 kinase ( XREF_BIBR ).  Whether SHPTP2 is involved in regulation of any of these  kinases in response to IL-5 remains to be determined.\n\nSHPTP2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after IL-5  stimulation. However, the biological significance of this  event as well as its relation to phosphatase activity is not yet  clear. Our data predict that the binding to the receptor  alone stimulates its catalytic activity. This result is consistent with a model in which IL-5 activates tyrosine kinases  and tyrosine kinases phosphorylate several tyrosines within  beta c . SHPTP2 then binds, via its SH2, to one or two phosphorylated tyrosines, which leads to a conformational change  in SHPTP2 and an increase of phosphatase activity. Once  bound to the receptor, SHPTP2 becomes a target for receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, perhaps Jak2 or Lyn kinases. It has been postulated that tyrosine phosphorylation  of SHPTP2 modulates its interaction with other SH2-containing signaling proteins such as Grb2. Grb2 tends to bind to  YXNX motif which is present on SHPTP2 (e.g., Y 542  and  Y 580 ). The binding of SHPTP2 to Grb2 is inhibited by  phosphopeptide containing this motif ( XREF_BIBR ). In our study,  SHPTP2 and Grb2 were coimmunoprecipitated by anti-SHPTP2 and anti-Grb2 antibody, respectively. At this time  we do not know whether Grb2 also binds to beta c  receptor.  Grb2 is known to bind to nucleotide-exchange protein  Sos, which activates Ras. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of  SHPTP2 may result in recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to the membrane, where the substrate for Sos, Ras, is  located ( XREF_BIBR ).\n\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that SHPTP2 functions as a positive growth regulator. Microinjection of  anti-SHPTP2 antibody results in decreased insulin-mediated mitogenesis ( XREF_BIBR ). Mutant inactive forms of SHPTP2  strongly inhibited the mitogenic signals induced by PDGF,  alpha-thrombin ( XREF_BIBR ), and IFN-alpha and -beta ( XREF_BIBR ). Further, negative  mutations of SHPTP2 led to inhibition of prolactin-induced  lactogenic signaling ( XREF_BIBR ). Using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against SHPTP2, we demonstrated a positive role of  the phosphatase in IL-5-induced activation of eosinophils.  Regardless of the target molecule for SHPTP2, this phosphatase appears to act upstream of Ras-Raf-MAP kinase  pathway activated in response to IL-5. Further, an activation of SHPTP2 phosphatase and Ras-Raf-MAP pathway  seems to be required for the delay of the death in eosinophils. In a recent paper, Yousefi et al. showed the requirement of Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases for the prevention of  apoptosis by IL-5 and GM-CSF in eosinophils ( XREF_BIBR ). Our  identification of SHPTP2 provides a further definition of  intracellular signaling pathways activated by IL-5 by showing the requirement of the tyrosine phosphatase for eosinophil survival.\n\n",
