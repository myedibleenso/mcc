      "text":"Resveratrol Induced Premature Senescence Is Associated with DNA Damage Mediated SIRT1 and SIRT2 Down-Regulation.\n\n\n\nThe natural polyphenolic compound resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) has broad spectrum health beneficial activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-cancer, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective effects. Remarkably, resveratrol also induces apoptosis and cellular senescence in primary and cancer cells. Resveratrol's anti-aging effects both in vitro and in vivo attributed to activation of a (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylase family member sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) protein. In mammals seven members (SIRT1-7) of sirtuin family have been identified. Among those, SIRT1 is the most extensively studied with perceptive effects on mammalian physiology and suppression of the diseases of aging. Yet no data has specified the role of sirtuins, under conditions where resveratrol treatment induces senescence. Current study was undertaken to investigate the effects of resveratrol in human primary dermal fibroblasts (BJ) and to clarify the role of sirtuin family members in particular SIRT1 and SIRT2 that are known to be involved in cellular stress responses and cell cycle, respectively. Here, we show that resveratrol decreases proliferation of BJ cells in a time and dose dependent manner. In addition the increase in senescence associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity and methylated H3K9-me indicate the induction of premature senescence. A significant increase in phosphorylation of gamma-H2AX, a surrogate of DNA double strand breaks, as well as in levels of p53, p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A  is also detected. Interestingly, at concentrations where resveratrol induced premature senescence we show a significant decrease in SIRT1 and SIRT2 levels by Western Blot and quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Conversely inhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT2 via siRNA or sirtinol treatment also induced senescence in BJ fibroblasts associated with increased SA-beta-gal activity, gamma-H2AX phosphorylation and p53, p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A  levels. Interestingly DNA damaging agent doxorubicin also induced senescence in BJ fibroblasts associated with decreased SIRT1/2 levels. In conclusion our data reveal that resveratrol induced premature senescence is associated with SIRT1 and SIRT2 down regulation in human dermal fibroblasts. Here we suggest that the concomitant decline in SIRT1/2 expression in response to resveratrol treatment may be a cause for induction of senescence, which is most likely mediated by a regulatory mechanism activated by DNA damage response.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nResveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural polyphenolic compound which exerts a number of health preserving effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, cardioprotective, neuroprotective activities [ XREF_BIBR ]. Different studies in cancer and primary cell lines as well as in animal models have connected resveratrol's anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and growth-inhibitory activities to the inhibition of proliferation in association with cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptotic cell death or senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, resveratrol has different activities in regulating multiple cellular events associated with carcinogenesis, and aging. Resveratrol's anti-aging effects both in vitro and in vivo attributed to activation of a (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylase family member sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) protein, the mammalian homologue of yeast Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\nSirtuins are a class of proteins retaining either histone deacetylase or mono-ribosyltransferase activity and have been implicated in various biological processes including aging, regulation of transcription, apoptosis and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and alertness under calorie restriction situations [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In mammals seven members (SIRT1-7) of sirtuin family have been identified which are localized to different subcellular compartments such as the nucleus (SIRT1, -2, -6, -7), cytoplasm (SIRT1 and SIRT2) and the mitochondria (SIRT3, -4 and -5) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Among those, SIRT1 is the most extensively studied within the last years, thus, many of its downstream mediators have been identified with perceptive effects on mammalian physiology and suppression of the diseases of aging, though, current evidence does not support that SIRT1 can increase mammalian longevity [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. On the other hand, there are studies indicating that sirtuins are not always committed to cell survival: under different stress conditions, SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 can protect the organism by inducing cell senescence or apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Interestingly a recent report has suggested that SIRT1 can counteract cellular senescence in human diploid fibroblasts [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nCellular senescence is a sustained anti-proliferative response arresting cell cycle. Depending on the activating signals it can be categorized as replicative and premature senescence [ XREF_BIBR ]. Replicative senescence was first described by Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961 in normal mammalian cells characterized by a finite replicative potential, limiting their lifespan to a certain number of divisions [ XREF_BIBR ], currently known to be induced via signals triggered by telomere shortening [ XREF_BIBR ]. Premature senescence, on the other hand, can be induced in young cells via several other mechanisms such as activation of certain oncogenes (e.g. Ras, Braf), inactivation of tumour supressor gene (e.g. Pten) or mitogenic stimulation, DNA damaging agents, oxidative stress [ XREF_BIBR ]. Senescence induced via activated oncogenes now accepted as a tumour suppressor mechanism acting as an initial barrier and preventing cells progression to cancer [ XREF_BIBR ]. Senescence is characterized by a number of morphological and biochemical changes including flattened morphology, increased senescence associated beta-galactosidase activity (SA-beta-gal) and increase in tri-methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9-3me) reflecting the formation of senescence associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) [ XREF_BIBR ]. The p16 INK4A -Rb and p53-p21 CIP1  pathways are well-known tumour suppressor pathways mediating the induction and maintenance of senescence [ XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, DNA damage response also known as crucial mediator of cellular senescence that involves activation of ATM/ATR (Ataxia Talengiectasia Mutataed)/(ATM and Rad3 related), kinases and phosphorylation of the histone variant gamma-H2AX [ XREF_BIBR ]. Induction of cellular senescence can be exploited for cancer therapy as it arrests cells proliferation and limits the life span whereas its impact on organismal aging is still debated [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Currently, senescent cells drawing more attention due to their multifaceted effects related to cancer prevention or progression as well as their possible impact on aging [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nPreviously it has been demonstrated that low doses of resveratrol can prevent the growth of cancer cells via induction of premature senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. However, resveratrol has been also shown to induce senescence in normal primary cells [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Interestingly, yet no data has specified the role of sirtuins, in particular the role SIRT1 under conditions where resveratrol induces premature senescence in primary cells. Thus, resveratrol seems to play a dual and somewhat opposite roles which certainly warrants for further investigations. Current study was undertaken to investigate whether resveratrol induces premature senescence in human primary dermal fibroblasts (BJ) and to clarify the role of sirtuin family members SIRT1 and SIRT2 in this context. Here we show that resveratrol treatment decreases BJ cells proliferation in a time and dose dependent manner associated with significantly increased SA-beta-gal activity and methylated H3K9-me. We also detected a significant increase in phosphorylation of gamma-H2AX and in expressions of p53, p21 CIP1  and p16INK4A in BJ cells. Interestingly at concentrations where resveratrol induced premature senescence we detected a significant decrease in SIRT1 and SIRT2 levels. Accordingly knock down of SIRT1 and SIRT2 via siRNA or their chemically inhibition via sirtinol also induced senescence in BJ fibroblasts associated with increased SA-beta-gal activity, gamma-H2AX phosphorylation and increased p53, p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A  levels. Interestingly in BJ fibroblasts doxorubicin-induced senescence is also associated with decreased SIRT1 and SIRT2 levels. Our results demonstrate that resveratrol induced decrease in SIRT1/2 expression may be a cause for induction of senescence which is most likely mediated by a regulatory mechanism activated by DNA damage response.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nResveratrol decreases BJ fibroblast's proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner.\n\nInitially to determine the effects of resveratrol on proliferation of BJ cells we performed a time and concentration-response analysis via Wst-1 proliferation assay. Results from Wst-1 assay showed that resveratrol had no significant effect on BJ cells proliferation at a concentration of up to 10 muM during 72h incubation. However starting with 10 muM, increasing concentrations (25, 50, 100 muM) of resveratrol significantly reduced cell proliferation within 24 h incubation, which was further decreased at 48h time point and reached to a maximum level at 72 h time point  XREF_FIG ). Next, in order to confirm data from Wst-1 proliferation assay we engaged BrdU incorporation assay using the same concentrations and time points. As shown in  XREF_FIG ., similar results were obtained from BrdU assay; with increasing concentrations of resveratrol (10, 25, 50, 100 muM), Brdu incorporation in to cellular DNA was gradually decreased during 24h, 48h incubation periods and maximum level of inhibition was detected at 72h, indicating resveratrol had significant inhibitory effect on BJ cell's proliferation in a time and dose dependent manner. We then assessed proliferation also by detection of the expression of Ki-67 antigen which is a widely used marker for measuring the growth fraction of a given cell population ( XREF_FIG ). Since we measured the maximum inhibition of proliferation at 72h time point we stained for Ki67 expression only at this time point utilizing the same concentrations. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Ki-67 antigen expression is significantly decreased in BJ cells treated with the increasing concentrations of resveratrol ( XREF_FIG ). Since we found that resveratrol decreases proliferation and inhibits growth of BJ cells we asked whether apoptosis was induced. Accordingly, we treated cells with same concentrations of resveratrol and measured apoptosis after 72h and found that resveratrol did not induce apoptosis at concentrations of 10, 25, 50muM but starting with 100 muM the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased to 8,3 +/-1,5 ( XREF_FIG ). When we increased the concentrations up to 200 and 300 muM, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased and reached to (37 +/-1,5) and (67+/-2,6) ( XREF_FIG ), respectively. Additionally we measured apoptosis by analysing cleaved Caspase-3 expression under same conditions. As seen in  XREF_FIG  cleaved caspase-3 was detectable in lysates of BJ fibroblasts treated with 100 to 300 muM of resveratrol. Thus, these results clearly show that in BJ fibroblasts resveratrol decreases proliferation in a time and dose-dependent manner and induce apoptosis only at higher concentrations between 100-300 muM.\n\n\n\nResveratrol induces premature senescence in BJ fibroblasts.\n\nSince we found that resveratrol decreases proliferation in BJ cells and apoptosis was not the main response at these concentrations, we investigated whether or not resveratrol treatment induces premature senescence in BJ cells. Increased SA-beta-gal activity is a well-known marker of senescence [ XREF_BIBR ], hence we measured senescence via SA-beta-gal staining. As shown in \" XREF_FIG \", the number of SA-beta-gal positive senescent cells was significantly increased in resveratrol-treated cells compared to control or DMSO treated cells. Furthermore, the percentage of SA-beta-gal positive cells increased with the concentrations of resveratrol indicates that resveratrol induces premature senescence in a dose-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nAccumulation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) [ XREF_BIBR ], is known as areas of condensed and transcriptionally silenced DNA, and a characteristic of senescence which can be detected by DAPI and H3K9-me3 co-staining. Thus we also tested whether resveratrol treatment results in generation of SAHFs in BJ cells via DAPI and H3K9-me3 co-staining. Results showed that H3K9-me3 positive stained cells were also increased in BJ cells treated with the increasing concentrations of resveratrol ( XREF_FIG ). These results clearly showed that resveratrol causes premature senescence in BJ fibroblasts.\n\n\n\nResveratrol induced senescence is mediated by DNA damage and involves activation of p53-p21 CIP1  and p16INK4A.\n\nRecent studies have shown that there is a casual link between senescence induction and DNA damage response (DDR). Formation of DNA damage foci containing activated gamma -H2A.X (gamma-H2A.X) at either uncapped telomeres or persistent DNA strand breaks is now recognised as an indication for DNA damage and activation of DDR. Consequently, gamma-H2A.Xstaining is established as a reliable quantitative indicator of DNA damage response as well as senescence [ XREF_BIBR ]. Accordingly we analysed the levels and activity of DDR by means of gamma-H2A.X staining in resveratrol treated cells. As shown in \" XREF_FIG \" starting with 10 muM resveratrol treatment BJ cells were positively stained for gamma-H2A.X and the percentage of positive stained cells were further increased by use of higher concentrations of resveratrol. Taken together these results suggest that resveratrol causes formation of gamma-H2A.X foci thus DNA damage which triggers cellular senescence in BJ fibroblasts.\n\nP53 and p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A  are key molecules involved in the execution of senescence; hence we examined the expression levels of p53, p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A  in resveratrol treated BJ fibroblasts. As shown by Western blotting the expression levels of p53, p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A  were significantly increased upon 10 muM of resveratrol treatment in BJ cells, compared to control or DMSO ( XREF_FIG ). These data suggest that resveratrol induced premature senescence is mediated by DNA damage and involves activation of p53-p21 pathway as well as activation of p16 INK4A  in BJ fibroblasts.\n\n\n\nResveratrol induced senescence is associated with attenuated SIRT1 and SIRT2 expression.\n\nPrevious studies have reported resveratrol, as an activator of Sir2 enzymes in vivo and in vitro. Resveratrol was shown to increase life span in three model organisms through a Sir2-dependent pathway [ XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore different studies suggest either senescence promoting or preventing role for sirtuins in particular for SIRT1 in different cell types [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Because we found that resveratrol induce premature senescence in BJ fibroblasts, we speculated whether or not the resveratrol induced senescence was dependent on sirtuins. We analysed expression of SIRT1 and SIRT2 the two members of sirtuin family known to be involved in cellular stress responses and cell cycle, respectively. Interestingly, Western blotting analysis showed that expression of SIRT1 and SIRT2 proteins were significantly decreased upon 10 muM resveratrol treatment and also continued at higher concentrations (25, 50 and 100 muM) ( XREF_FIG ). We confirmed these data by RT-qPCR analysis and showed that mRNA level of SIRT1 and SIRT2 was also significantly decreased starting with 10muM resveratrol treatment in BJ fibroblasts ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nInhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT2 by siRNA or Sirtinol induces senescence in BJ fibroblasts.\n\nNext we used RNA interference to knock down SIRT1 and SIRT2 expressions in order to answer the question whether or not down regulation of SIRT1/2 involved in induction of senescence in BJ fibroblasts. Accordingly transfection of specific siRNA oligos independently targeting SIRT1 and SIRT2 significantly decreased expression of SIRT1/2 ( XREF_FIG ) and induced senescence as shown by increased SA-betagal activity in BJ fibroblasts ( XREF_FIG ). Induction of senescence is mediated by DNA damage as evidenced by formation of-H2A.X foci ( XREF_FIG ) and activation of p53-p21 CIP1  pathway ( XREF_FIG ). A slight increase in levels of p16 INK4A  was also detected ( XREF_FIG ). Though, apoptosis was not detectable at this time point as we did not detect expression of cleaved caspase-3 ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nUpon finding that genetic knock down of SIRT1 /2 induces senescence we asked whether or not chemical inhibitors of sirtuin family members show similar effects. We used a well-known chemical inhibitor, namely sirtinol in order to repress SIRT1/2 activity as suggested in previous reports [ XREF_BIBR ]. As shown in \" XREF_FIG \" 100 muM sirtinol treatment induced senescence in BJ fibroblasts as evidenced by increased SA-betagal activity ( XREF_FIG ). Consistent with previous reports [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] we detected a slight decrease in SIRT1/2 expressions in BJ fibroblasts in response to sirtinol treatment suggesting SIRT1/2 activity might also play a role in regulation of sirtinol induced senescence. Additionally, increased levels of p53, p21 CIP1  and p16  INK4A  expressions were also detected by sirtinol treatment. More importantly 100 muM of sirtinol induced gamma -H2A.X foci formation indicating to the activation of DNA damage response ( XREF_FIG ). However no cleaved caspase-3 expression was detected with 100 muM of sirtinol treatment indicating apoptosis is not induced at this concentration in BJ fibroblasts ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nDoxorubicin induced senescence is associated with reduced SIRT1 and SIRT2 expressions.\n\nSince we found that resveratrol induced senescence is mediated by DNA damage and down regulation of SIRT1 and SIRT2 expressions we asked whether or not DNA damaging agents that are capable of inducing senescence can reduce expressions of SIRT1/2. Thus in order to induce senescence we treated BJ cells with 50 and 100 ng/ml of doxorubicin for 5 days as suggested in literature [ XREF_BIBR ]. As shown in \" XREF_FIG \", induction of senescence was evident with increased SA-beta-gal activity, increased levels of p53 and p21 CIP1  and gamma-H2A.X foci formation. Additionally, when we tested p16  INK4A  levels we found rather minor increase in p16 INK4A  levels suggesting doxorubicin induced senescence is mediated mainly by activation of p53-p21 pathway ( XREF_FIG ). Remarkably WB analysis showed that expressions of SIRT1/2 were also slightly reduced during doxorubicin induced senescence ( XREF_FIG ). These data suggest that DNA damage induced senescence is also associated with SIRT1/2 decrease.\n\nTaken together our data clearly show that resveratrol induced senescence is mediated by DNA damage, and mainly by activation of key players of senescence such as p53, p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A . More importantly we show here that there is a concomitant decline in levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 associated with resveratrol as well as DNA damage induced senescence in BJ fibroblasts suggesting these processes might be governed by a common regulatory mechanism involving DNA damage response.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nResveratrol is a polyphenolic compound with broad spectrum health beneficial activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-cancer, cardioprotective, neuroprotective effects [ XREF_BIBR ]. Resveratrol's anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and growth-inhibitory effects are mainly attributed to the inhibition of proliferation in association with cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptotic cell death or senescence [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Resveratrol's anti-aging effects both in vitro and in vivo attributed to activation of a sirtuin family member SIRT1, though current data does not support that SIRT1 can increase mammalian longevity. On the other hand studies showing SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 can protect the organism by inducing cell senescence or apoptosis indicated that sirtuins are not always committed to cell survival. Interestingly, controversial reports have shown that SIRT1 counteracts cellular senescence in human diploid fibroblasts [ XREF_BIBR ]. [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, this study has been conceived to clarify the role of sirtuins during resveratrol induced senescence in BJ fibroblasts. Here, we show that resveratrol decreases proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts in a time and dose dependent manner associated with the induction of premature senescence. Resveratrol induced premature senescence is mediated by DNA damage and involves activation of p53 and p21 CIP1  and p16 INK4A . More importantly resveratrol induced senescence is associated with a concomitant decrease in SIRT1 and SIRT2 levels which is most likely mediated by DNA damage in BJ fibroblasts. We provide a number of evidence supporting this conclusion. At first, by employing three different assays including Wst-1, Brdu incorporation and Ki67 staining we showed that starting with 10 muM of resveratrol treatment, proliferation of BJ fibroblast's decreases in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Importantly at these concentrations apoptosis is not detectable. Accordingly we showed that at same concentrations where proliferation is decreased resveratrol induces premature senescence in BJ fibroblasts as evidenced by senescence hallmarks such as increased SA-beta-gal activity, and increased H3K9me3 marks reflecting the formation of SAHFs. Previously Demidenko and Blagosklonny also analysed the effects of resveratrol on human embryonic lung fibroblasts WI-38 and found that resveratrol prevents senescence but this was rather at high, near-toxic concentrations [ XREF_BIBR ]. On the other hand Faragher et al. [ XREF_BIBR ] showed that above 25muM resveratrol concentrations produces a dose dependent reduction in proliferation of human foetal lung fibroblasts associated with increased SA-beta-gal activity. In general, our data are in line with these reports; the only slight difference is that in BJ (foreskin) fibroblasts as low as 10 muM of resveratrol can induce senescence whereas 100muM or over induce apoptosis. Hence, we suggest that the differences between resveratrol concentrations may result from the cell types. Recent data has shown that low doses (10-50 muM) of resveratrol induce senescence in lung cancer cells suggesting that resveratrol may exert its anticancer and chemo-preventive effects also through the induction of premature senescence [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, our data showing low concentrations of resveratrol induces senescence in human dermal fibroblasts suggesting that this activity of resveratrol is not selective for cancer cells. More importantly, increasing evidences suggest deleterious effects of senescent cells on the tissue microenvironment due to senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) turning senescent fibroblasts into pro-inflammatory cells which consequently contribute to promote tumour progression [ XREF_BIBR ]. Thus our findings also point out to an important issue for cancer therapy and warrants for further investigations to explore whether or not resveratrol induced SASP may become an important concern for cancer therapy in future.\n\nRecent reports indicate to resveratrol's DNA damaging effects or its ability to induce senescence involving DNA damage and activation of p53-and p21 CIP1  pathway [ XREF_BIBR ]. In line with recent reports, in our study we show gamma-H2AX foci formation (an essential surrogate of DNA DSBs [ XREF_BIBR ]) during resveratrol induced senescence, suggesting eventually senescence is mediated by DNA damage in BJ fibroblasts. Beside, p53 and p21 CIP1 , p16 INK4A  levels are also significantly increased suggesting both p53-p21 and Rb-p16 pathways play key role in induction and maintenance of resveratrol induced senescence. More importantly here we show that there is a concomitant decline in mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 during resveratrol induced senescence in BJ fibroblasts. We've verified this data by showing that SIRT1/2 inhibition either by sirtinol treatment or via RNA interference induces DNA damage mediated senescence in BJ fibroblasts as evidenced by increased SA-betagal activity and increased p53, p21CIP1 and p16INK4A levels. Consistent with our findings a previous report has indicated that the level of SIRT1 also decreases with serial cell passages as cells approach to replicative senescence [ XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, according to literature in mouse and human cells as proliferation decreases either in vivo or in vitro, there is a concomitant decline in the level of SIRT1. In our study in addition to SIRT1 we show that the level of SIRT2 is also decreased as proliferation decreases. More importantly our data which show gammaH2AX foci formation in response to sirtinol or siRNA treatment suggesting SIRT1/2 inhibition is mediated by DNA damage response. We provide additional data supporting this conclusion by showing that expression of SIRT1/2 were also slightly decreased during DNA damage induced (doxorubicin) senescence. Hence, here we suggest that the concomitant decline in SIRT1/2 levels in response to resveratrol treatment may be a cause for induction of senescence. Interestingly supporting our assumption recent reports suggest, the tumor supresssor gene HIC1 (hypermethylated in Cancer 1) which is widely expressed in healthy tissues but deleted in cancer is activated by DNA double strand breaks and plays a central role in the DNA damage response and DNA repair through the establishment of several complex regulatory loops involving, HIC1, p53, HDAC4, SIRT1 and E2F1[ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Chen and colleagues [ XREF_BIBR ] put forward a model of the HIC1-SIRT1-p53 regulatory loop in which under normal conditions, stress-induced rapid accumulation of p53 activates the HIC1 gene. HIC1 then binds to SIRT1 to form a transcriptional repression complex. The SIRT1/HIC1 complex is recruited to the SIRT1 promoter to suppress SIRT1 transcription. Reduced SIRT1 levels are apparently responsible for increased acetylation level of p53, thereby facilitating its functions of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR ]. Thus taken together, we cannot rule out the possibility that activated HIC1 might be involved in regulation of SIRT1/2 levels in BJ fibroblasts. To our knowledge our study is the first demonstration of down regulation of both SIRT1 and SIRT2 upon induction of senescence in response to resveratrol or doxorubicin treatment in human primary cells. Currently our knowledge on the mechanism of SIRT1 and SIRT2 down regulation and its contribution to DNA damage induced senescence or vice versa is limited, nevertheless, an effort is underway to fully understand the mechanism(s) of down regulation and the relationship with DNA damage response.\n\nIn conclusion our data reveal that resveratrol treatment induces premature senescence in human dermal fibroblasts that is mediated by DNA damage and by activation of p53-p21and Rb-p16 pathways. More importantly concomitant decline in the levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 upon resveratrol treatment may be a cause for induction of senescence which is most likely mediated by a regulatory mechanism activated by DNA damage response. Based on the above data we put forward a possible model how resveratrol treatment induces senescence via down regulation of SIRT1 and SIRT2 shown in \" XREF_FIG \" ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n",
