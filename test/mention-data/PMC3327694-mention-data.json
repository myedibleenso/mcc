      "text":"Reactive Oxygen Species Regulate the Levels of Dual Oxidase (Duox1-2) in Human Neuroblastoma Cells.\n\n\n\nDual Oxidases (DUOX) 1 and 2 are efficiently expressed in thyroid, gut, lung and immune system. The function and the regulation of these enzymes in mammals are still largely unknown. We report here that DUOX 1 and 2 are expressed in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells as well as in a human oligodendrocyte cell line (MO3-13) and in rat brain and they are induced by platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). The levels of DUOX 1 and 2 proteins and mRNAs are induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the membrane NADPH oxidase. As to the mechanism, we find that PDGF stimulates membrane NADPH oxidase to produce ROS, which stabilize DUOX1 and 2 mRNAs and increases the levels of the proteins. Silencing of gp91 phox  (NOX2), or of the other membrane subunit of NADPH oxidase, p22 phox , blocks PDGF induction of DUOX1 and 2. These data unravel a novel mechanism of regulation of DUOX enzymes by ROS and identify a circuitry linking NADPH oxidase activity to DUOX1 and 2 levels in neuroblastoma cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nDual oxidases or DUOX (the products of DUOX 1 and 2 genes) are NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes (EC 1.6.3.1) that contain the membrane-bound flavocytochrome segment of NADPH oxidase, fused to an extra-cellular peroxidase (EC 1.11.1) domain  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . DUOX1 and 2 were first cloned in the thyroid but their expression has been so far demonstrated in several tissues, especially colon, lung and immune system  XREF_BIBR . Although these enzymes are important sources of local ROS, their function and regulation are still unknown. In thyroid DUOX proteins are localized to the apical pole of follicular cells, where they produce H 2 O 2 , necessary for organification of iodine and synthesis of thyroid hormones  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Targeted production of ROS by DUOX enzymes seems essential for gut immunity in Drosophila  XREF_BIBR . Since ROS production may be harmful to the tissue, DUOX enzymes are regulated by several positive and negative signals to finely adjust ROS production to the changing environment in lung or intestinal epithelium  XREF_BIBR . A positive stimulus is received by a not-yet identified G protein-coupled receptor, which signals through phospholipase C (PLC)-beta to activate DUOX 1 and 2 expression; Ca ++  ions, which are essential for their enzymatic activity, are able also to stimulate or inhibit DUOX 1 and 2 expression. As example, Ca ++  activates calcineurin, which represses the transcription of DUOX 1 and 2 genes  XREF_BIBR .\n\nWhile targeted production of ROS is an essential element controlling immune homeostasis in gut, the function and the regulation of DUOX enzymes in other cell types, such as neurons, not directly exposed to the foreign environment, are not obvious. DUOX are also expressed in the respiratory tract epithelium and are differentially regulated by cytokines, but their specific function in this compartment remains still elusive  XREF_BIBR .\n\nROS modulate different physiological functions, beside innate immunity, such as the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, cellular signalling, gene expression, cellular growth and death  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Oscillations of ROS levels mark proliferation and neoplastic transformation  XREF_BIBR . Inhibitors of oxidases (NOX/DUOX) appear to prevent in some circumstances complications in chronic diseases  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR .\n\nROS produced by NOX enzymes have been demonstrated to exert cell signalling functions in CNS modulating neuronal differentiation  XREF_BIBR , synaptic activity  XREF_BIBR , learning, memory and long term potentiation  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , etc. The presence of constitutive or inducible NOX1-4 isoforms have been widely demonstrated in CNS (for a review see  XREF_BIBR ). Instead, the expression of DUOX enzymes in cells of CNS is not been clearly documented and no data are available about the regulation or functions of these enzymes in the CNS. The current proposed function of DUOX as component of peroxidase-host defence system, which is similar to the MPO-hydrogen peroxide in neutrophils, is easily applicable to lung, gut, thyroid, but difficult to extrapolate it to neurons.\n\nTo find the function of the DUOX system in neuronal cells, we have first investigated the presence of DUOX1 and 2 proteins in the brain and then the regulation of their expression in SK-N-BE cells. We have previously demonstrated that, in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells, the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway stimulates NADPH oxidase inducing ROS levels  XREF_BIBR . By using a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques, we here demonstrate that DUOX 1 and 2 are rapidly induced by ROS produced by membrane NADPH oxidase. PDGF activates NADPH oxidase and increases ROS levels, which stabilize DUOX 1 and 2 mRNAs. These data reveal a regulatory network linking membrane NADPH oxidase, ROS and DUOX1 and 2 levels and highlight a novel function of DUOX enzymes in neurons as ROS sensors.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nDUOX proteins are expressed in the brain.\n\nSince the presence of DUOX enzymes in the brain has not been firmly demonstrated, we first have analyzed by Western blotting the expression of DUOX1 and 2 proteins in rat brain, in a stabilized human oligodendrocytes cell line (M03-13) and in neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE) cells ( XREF_FIG ). In addition, to obtain information on the localization of these proteins at cell level, we have evaluated their presence in the membrane fraction of rat brain tissue. Both cell lines tested and brain tissue express high levels of the proteins that are concentrated in membranes. A specific DUOX immunoreactivity in the brain has been detected also in rat coronal brain slices by confocal immunofluorescence analysis ( XREF_FIG ). Large brain areas, in part corresponding to cortical layers, are selectively immunostained for DUOX. Higher magnification shows that the signal is confined to the cell body and dendrites.\n\n\n\nPDGF stimulates DUOX1 and 2 levels by increasing ROS in neuroblastoma cells.\n\nTo study the regulation of these proteins, we have stimulated SK-N-BE cells with PDGF, which exerts trophic effects on a variety of neurons  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . PDGF induces DUOX proteins in cells preincubated for 18 hrs in medium containing 0.2% FBS in a dose- and time-dependent manner with a peak of activity at 15 ng/ml for 15 min ( XREF_FIG ). These conditions have been used for all subsequent experiments. Serum starvation does not exert any toxic effect as evidenced measuring cell death by propidium iodide staining and cytofluorimetric analysis; also, serum starvation strongly downregulates the phosphorilation levels of ERK1/2, a kinase downstream PDGFR (data not shown) that normally increases in stress conditions.\n\nSince PDGF stimulates in many cellular systems, neurons included, NADPH oxidase and increase ROS production  XREF_BIBR  and (Agnese et al. in preparation), we have tested if ROS produced by membrane NADPH oxidase mediate PDGF effects on DUOX1 and 2 expression. To this end, we have treated the cells with PDGF or 10% FBS in the presence of apocynin, a ROS scavenger and inhibitor of NADPH oxidase  XREF_BIBR . Pre-treatment of cells with apocynin eliminates PDGF or 10% FBS induction of the protein ( XREF_FIG ) and mRNAs ( XREF_FIG ). The induction of DUOX 1 and 2 protein and mRNA levels by FBS indicates that growth factors other than PDGF could play a similar role in the regulation of the expression of these proteins. Also, hydrogen peroxide alone is able to induce DUOX protein and mRNA levels and this effect is eliminated by apocynin, an anti-oxidant an NADPH inhibitor  XREF_BIBR  ( XREF_FIG ). These data indicate that ROS, induced by PDGF and other growth factors, stimulate DUOX1 and 2 expression (proteins and mRNAs); apocynin, as anti-oxidant and NADPH oxidase inhibitor  XREF_BIBR , prevents PDGF, FBS or H 2 O 2  induction of DUOX, suggesting that ROS, possibly generated by NADPH oxidase, mediate such an effect. To find the role of NADPH oxidase (NOX) on DUOX1-2 expression, we first determined which NOX is expressed in neuroblastoma cells.  XREF_FIG  shows that SK-N-BE cells express NOX2 and NOX5, as colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2) used as control  XREF_BIBR  and NOX3 ( XREF_FIG ). Since the membrane subunit p22 phox  is closely associated with the catalytic membrane subunit of 4 of the 5 NOX isoforms (NOX1-4)  XREF_BIBR , we have silenced this subunit to knock down all the NOX isoforms in SKB cells.  XREF_FIG  shows that the specific siRNAs selectively reduce p22 phox  protein levels and eliminate PDGF induction of DUOX enzymes ( XREF_FIG ). PDGF induction of DUOX 1 and 2 mRNA levels is also abolished by p22 phox  silencing ( XREF_FIG ). We have silenced also NOX2 ( XREF_FIG ) and we found that PDGF induction of DUOX protein ( XREF_FIG ) and mRNA levels ( XREF_FIG ) was abolished as well as in p22 phox  knock-down cells. The maturation factor DUOXA1, which is essential for the biological activity of the enzyme, is also stimulated by PDGF but its induction is not influenced by NOX2 levels ( XREF_FIG ). Taken together these data indicate that NOX2 is the major inducer of DUOX expression in neuroblastoma cells exposed to PDGF.\n\nWe next have examined whether the induction of DUOX1 and 2 mRNA levels by PDGF is mediated by stimulation of gene transcription or by a post-transcriptional mechanism. To test specifically this point, we have measured the half-life of DUOX1 and 2 mRNAs by exposing the cells for various periods of time to actinomycin D, under conditions of selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II-driven transcription.  XREF_FIG  show that the mRNAs of both proteins decay with a rapid kinetic with an half-life of 11min and 14 min for DUOX1 and DUOX2, respectively. PDGF is able to induce DUOX1-2 mRNA levels even in the presence of actinomycin D. In fact, the decay of the DUOX mRNAs was significantly modified by PDGF. The half-life of DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNAs in cells exposed to PDGF is approximately 299 and 196 min, respectively, compared to 11 and 14 min, respectively in the absence of PDGF. This induction is mediated by ROS, because co-incubation of the cells with PDGF and apocynin in the presence of actinomycin D, eliminates the effects of PDGF on mRNAs stabilization by decreasing the half-life (18.5 and 22 min for DUOX1 and DUOX2, respectively). Under these conditions, apocynin inhibition of PDGF induction is reversed by hydrogen peroxide (not shown) supporting the hypothesis that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase are mediators of PDGF effects on mRNA stability. Western blotting analysis of DUOX protein levels measured in the same experimental conditions, shows that the time-dependent decay of the proteins in the presence of actinomycin D and PDGF is similar to that of mRNA levels and that apocynin inhibits PDGF induction of DUOX proteins. Collectively, these data indicate that PDGF regulates DUOX1-2 levels by modifying the stability of the specific mRNAs and that this effect is mediated by ROS generated by NADPH oxidases ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nPDGF stimulates both NOX and DUOX enzymes.\n\nTo test whether higher levels of DUOX proteins are translated into higher levels of enzymatic activity, we have measured ROS levels in the presence or absence of the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. Since DUOX activity is tightly dependent on calcium, the difference between ROS levels measured in the presence and absence of BAPTA-AM represents an indirect measure of DUOX activity. We note, however, that also the activity of NOX5, expressed by neuroblastoma cells ( XREF_FIG ), is stimulated by calcium; NOX5 does not require p22 phox  subunit  XREF_BIBR  and is not involved in the PDGF induction of ROS and DUOX1-2 expression, since silencing of p22  phox  inhibits PDGF induction as well as silencing of NOX2 ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ). Therefore, under our conditions, we believe that the major Ca-stimulated ROS producing activity induced by PDGF is the activity of DUOX enzymes. PDGF induces total ROS levels through NADPH oxidase activation as demonstrated by the inhibition of ROS induction by PDGF in the presence of NADPH oxidase inhibitor AEBSF ( XREF_FIG ). In addition,  XREF_FIG  shows that a substantial fraction of PDGF stimulated-ROS is sensitive to BAPTA-AM and that calcium-resistant ROS (mainly produced by the other NOX enzymes) increase faster than the calcium-sensitive fraction (mainly DUOX-dependent), suggesting that NOX precedes DUOX activation. To test directly whether the induction of extracellular H 2 O 2  levels by PDGF were mediated by NADPH oxidase activation, we measured extracellular H 2 O 2  in cells, in which p22 phox  was silenced by the specific siRNA. In these cells PDGF was not able to induce extracellular H 2 O 2  ( XREF_FIG ) as well as and DUOX1 and 2 expression ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nCollectively, these data demonstrate that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase mediate PDGF induction of DUOX 1 and 2 expression by stabilizing the specific mRNAs.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\n\n\nDUOX in brain.\n\nThis is the first report demonstrating the presence of DUOX in the brain by immunofluorescent staining of rat brain slices or by immunoblot analysis of rat brain membrane and oligodendrocyte or neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cell line ( XREF_FIG ). The function of DUOX enzymes in the nervous system and specifically in neuronal cells is not apparently linked to the innate immunity, as shown in other tissues. DUOX proteins are dual function enzymes, containing not only the ROS generating domain, homologous to NADPH enzymes but also a peroxidase domain, that may be used to carry on oxidations of other proteins. In C. Elegans, for example a similar Duox enzyme catalyzes the cross link of tyrosine residues in the cuticle (for a review see  XREF_BIBR ). It is possible that a ROS-regulated activity of DUOX enzyme may be important in neurons to modify membrane proteins during synapses formation or maintenance.\n\n\n\nPDGF stimulates DUOX 1 and 2 expression.\n\nThe data reported here indicate that PDGF and serum are able to induce rapidly DUOX1 and 2 in neuroblastoma cells ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ). PDGF induces a rapid (15-30 min) post-transcriptional stabilization of the DUOX1 and 2 specific mRNAs ( XREF_FIG ), by stimulating the membrane NADPH oxidase, which appears to be the first target of PDGFR action. Thus, PDGF induction of DUOX1 and 2 is abolished by silencing p22 phox  or NOX2 ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ). Our data indicate that DUOX mRNAs are very unstable in the absence of ROS and consequently also the levels of the protein are low under these conditions. Stimulation of the cells by growth factors or microrganisms can induce a strong cellular response by increasing the levels of DUOX proteins on the membranes.\n\nWe suggest the following link between PDGF and DUOX: PDGF and its receptor binds NOX2 (Agnese et al., in preparation), induces ERK 1/2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which in turn activate NADPH oxidase  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . ROS, produced by NADPH oxidase, inhibit tyrosine phsophatases and maintain active ERK1/2  XREF_BIBR . Ultimately, ERK1/2 may stabilize the specific DUOX1-2 mRNAs and increase the levels of the proteins  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR .\n\n\n\nDUOX1 and 2 are exquisite sensors of ROS in neurons.\n\nOur data indicate that DUOX 1 and 2 mRNAs are rapidly degraded under normal conditions and accumulate upon oxidative stress ( XREF_FIG ). Following PDGF stimulation, cellular ROS increase and this is accompanied by rise of DUOX enzymes ( XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ). We do not know the specific function of DUOX in neurons but it is possible that targeted DUOX protein focus ROS production in a specific membrane compartment contacting the extra-pericellular space ( XREF_FIG ). In other cell types, such as thyroid cells or leukocytes, this is relevant for the formation of the iodine fixation complex on the apical membrane of thyroid cells or the formation of the spatial tissue gradient of hydrogen peroxide, required for rapid recruitment of leukocytes to the wound  XREF_BIBR .\n\n\n\nThe function of DUOX enzymes: focusing and targeting ROS production to the membrane.\n\nThe regulation of DUOX expression by ROS seems conserved in different cell types. In lymphocytes, calcium and ROS generate a loop that modulates the strength of the final signal triggered by the receptor(s) and DUOX activity is central in this circuitry  XREF_BIBR . ROS production, upon DUOX induction, becomes restricted to discrete membrane segments. Apparently, this function cannot be complemented by membrane NADPH oxidase and has been exploited by intestinal epithelium for maintenance of gut immunity  XREF_BIBR , by thyroid cells for iodine organification  XREF_BIBR  and by lymphocytes for signaling  XREF_BIBR . It remains to be seen the function of DUOX in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Highly compartmentalized ROS production coupled to peroxidase activity may induce membrane fusion by cross-linking membrane proteins. We believe and suggest that this may be relevant in neurons for the formation and maintenance of synapses.\n\n",
