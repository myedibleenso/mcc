      "text":"Combination therapy targeting ectopic ATP synthase and 26S proteasome induces ER stress in breast cancer cells.\n\n\n\nF 1 F o  ATP synthase is present in all organisms and is predominantly located on the inner membrane of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. The present study demonstrated that ATP synthase and electron transport chain complexes were ectopically expressed on the surface of breast cancer cells and could serve as a potent anticancer target. We investigated the anticancer effects of the ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin on breast cancer cells through proteomic approaches and revealed that differentially expressed proteins in cell cycle regulation and in the unfolded protein response were functionally enriched. We showed that citreoviridin triggered PERK-mediated eIF2alpha phosphorylation, which in turn attenuated general protein synthesis and led to cell cycle arrest in the G 0 /G 1  phase. We further showed that the combination of citreoviridin and the 26S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib could improve the anticancer activity by enhancing ER stress, by ameliorating citreoviridin-caused cyclin D 3  compensation, and by contributing to CDK1 deactivation and PCNA downregulation. More interestingly, the combined treatment triggered lethality through unusual non-apoptotic caspase- and autophagy-independent cell death with a cytoplasmic vacuolization phenotype. The results imply that by boosting ER stress, the combination of ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin and 26S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib could potentially be an effective therapeutic strategy against breast cancer.\n\n\n\nBreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. More than 235000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer annually in the United States, and approximately 40000 women are expected to die from the disease in 2014. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Treating breast cancer with a combination of treatment options, such as hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and targeted therapies aims to provide clinical benefits, to improve patients' quality of life, and to minimize side effects. However, an increase in the number of unresponsive and resistant cases for standard treatments, including aromatase inhibitors, estrogen receptor antagonists, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted monoclonal antibody, and taxane chemotherapies, has been reported. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Therefore novel therapeutic biomarkers and new treatment options that overcome resistance are needed.\n\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase is a membrane-associated protein complex comprising two sectors: the water-soluble catalytic sector (F 1 ) with the subunit composition alpha 3 beta 3 gammadeltaepsilon, and the membrane-bound proton-translocating sector (F o ) with the subunit composition ab 2 c 10  -15.  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  ATP synthase catalyzes the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate to ATP through the proton-motive force generated by the electron transport chain (ETC) in energy-transducing membranes. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  ATP synthase is predominantly located on the membranes of mitochondria, bacteria, and chloroplast thylakoids. Recent studies have shown that ATP synthase is present on the plasma membrane (PM) of highly proliferating cell types in eukaryotes, including cancer cells, XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  endothelial cells, XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  keratinocytes, 17  adipocytes, 18  and hepatocytes. 19 \n\nPreviously, we demonstrated that an ATP synthase inhibitor causes cytotoxicity to breast cancer and lung cancer cells but not to normal cells, XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  suggesting that the ATP synthase inhibitor may be a potential drug for breast cancer therapy. To further understand the effects of the ATP synthase inhibitor on breast cancer cells, we performed proteomics approaches to investigate the differential expression profiles of breast cancer cells in response to ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin.\n\nCitreoviridin is a toxic metabolite isolated from molds of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus. 20  Citreoviridin contains alpha-pyrone, a six-membered cyclic unsaturated ester that binds to the ATP synthase beta subunit and causes toxicity to bacteria. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  In the present study, we used citreoviridin to treat cancer cells and revealed the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon drug treatment.\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is responsible for protein folding, lipid and sterol biosynthesis, and intracellular calcium storage. 23  Perturbations in ER homeostasis result in UPR by activating three ER-resident transmembrane transducers: inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Subsequently, phosphorylated PERK further phosphorylates Ser51 on the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) and leads to general inhibition of translation and cell cycle arrest, thus preventing further influx of nascent proteins into the ER lumen. 29  Simultaneously, dimerization and autophosphorylation of IRE1 and cleavage of ATF6 in the Golgi result in the gene expression of protein chaperones and components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery. 30 \n\nOn the basis of cellular responses to ER stress, we intended to intensify cell death signaling by inducing the UPR and by inhibiting ERAD with citreoviridin and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, respectively. Consequently, we revealed the prompting of cytoplasmic vacuolization, which implies induction of a novel type of methuosis-like cell death.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nATP synthase was ectopically expressed on the PM of mammary cancer cells.\n\nTo explore the ectopic expression of ATP synthase, we performed immunocytochemical tests on three breast cancer cell lines (i.e., MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231) and non-oncogenic breast cells MCF10A. We observed punctate localization of ectopic ATP synthase on the PM of cancer cells but not on MCF10A cells ( XREF_FIG ). Furthermore, the expression of ATP5B was observed in the PM fraction in MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest that the specific expression of ectopic ATP synthase on cancer cells might be a potential drug-targeting signature for breast cancer.\n\n\n\nETC complex proteins were ectopically expressed on the PM of MCF7 cells.\n\nTo further investigate whether ETC was also ectopically expressed on the PM, we applied antibody-probing selected proteins from complexes I to IV to monitor the extracellular and mitochondrial distribution of the ETC and ATP synthase. We revealed the ectopic expression of complexes I-IV on the PM, but the complexes varied in pattern and size ( XREF_FIG ). All of the ectopic expression in the non-permeable group was punctated, distinct from the network-like distribution in the permeable mitochondrial group, implying the ectopic ETC and ATP synthase might cluster at specific membrane structure of the PM.\n\n\n\nATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin inhibited proliferation of mammary cancer cells.\n\nTo examine the inhibitory efficacy of citreoviridin against cell proliferation, we utilized a real-time cell analyzer to monitor cell responses to the drug over time. The results indicate that citreoviridin was cytotoxic to breast cancer cells MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 but not to the non-tumorigenic MCF10A ( XREF_FIG ). To evaluate the effect of citreoviridin on mitochondria, we examined the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) after 48-h treatment in MCF7 cells whose proliferation was inhibited by citreoviridin mostly. The result exhibited that the MMP was not affected during the course of the treatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), implying the use of citreoviridin at the present dosage and treatment duration would at least not cause damages in mitochondrial function.\n\n\n\nCitreoviridin altered protein expression involving regulation of the cell cycle and ubiquitin-dependent protein modification.\n\nTo determine the effects of citreoviridin on global protein expression, we utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. We found that 15 proteins were differentially expressed after 24 and 48h of citreoviridin treatment, with protein pI values ranging from 4 to 7 and from 3 to 10 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Among the 15 identified proteins, 14 were significantly enriched in the protein-protein interaction (P=6.12 x 10 -6 ) compared with 3.16 expected interactions within the genome background ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). To analyze the major biological processes in which the identified proteins were involved, we applied gene ontology enrichment analysis. The analysis revealed that the most enriched biological processes were cell cycle phase transition (P=2.96 x 10 -6 ), intracellular signaling (P=3.43 x 10 -6 ), protein modification (P=6.57 x 10 -6 ), regulation of apoptotic cell death (P=9.99 x 10 -6 ), proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism (P=1.52 x 10 -5 ), response to unfolded proteins (P=1.65 x 10 -4 ), and ER-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism (P=4.09 x 10 -4 ).\n\n\n\nCitreoviridin arrested cell cycle progression in the G 0 /G 1  phase.\n\nFunctional enrichment analysis of proteomic data indicated that citreoviridin might regulate cell cycle progression. To verify this effect, we analyzed the DNA content distribution in response to citreoviridin by flow cytometry. The results show that citreoviridin significantly led to an accumulation of DNA content in the G 0 /G 1  phase from 56.21% to 72.34% after 48-h treatment in MCF7 but not in MCF10A ( XREF_FIG ). Molecular evidence also indicates that citreoviridin augmented the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p21, reduced the protein expression of the G 0 /G 1  cell cycle regulators cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D 1 , and contributed to a decrease in retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting the inhibition of entry into the S phase in the cell cycle.\n\n\n\nCitreoviridin triggered UPR and PERK-mediated eIF2alpha phosphorylation.\n\nThe functional enrichment analysis also emphasized the involvement of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, response to unfolded proteins, and ER-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism. In response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, cells activate the UPR to cope with the unfolded proteins. This occurs by inhibition of protein synthesis and by increasing chaperones and redox proteins to assist protein folding through a series of signaling from the ER lumen. We revealed that citreoviridin induced the UPR by triggering the protein expression or phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2alpha, IRE1alpha, and Ero1-Lalpha ( XREF_FIG ). We further demonstrated that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of PERK alleviated eIF2alpha phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ), implying that PERK activation mediates induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation.\n\n\n\nCombination of citreoviridin and bortezomib suppressed cell proliferation and anchorage-dependent and -independent colony-forming ability.\n\nTo verify whether augmentation of ER stress by induction of UPR and inhibition of ERAD could intensify the cell death signal, we combined citreoviridin, which triggered the UPR we presented previously ( XREF_FIG ), and the proteasome-specific inhibitor bortezomib and measured their combined efficacy. The results show that citreoviridin and bortezomib exhibited an additive effect on MCF7 cell growth, with a combination index of 0.97 at 48-h co-treatment ( XREF_FIG ). Additionally, we demonstrated that combination of citreoviridin and bortezomib reduced the colony-forming ability through anchorage-dependent and -independent routes ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nBortezomib decreased citreoviridin-caused cyclin D 3  compensation and enhanced inhibition of entry into the S phase.\n\nSubsequently, we analyzed the effects of bortezomib and citreoviridin on cell cycle progression and found that the combined treatment caused elevated populations in both the G 0 /G 1  and G 2 /M phases accompanied by a significant reduction in the S phase ( XREF_FIG ). The cell cycle regulators phospho-Rb, CDK4, cyclin D 1,  phospho-CDK1, cyclin B 1 , Cdc25C, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were inhibited by citreoviridin alone and in combination with bortezomib ( XREF_FIG ). We also revealed that the combination of bortezomib and citreoviridin inhibited citreoviridin-induced compensation of cyclin D 3  and CDK6, thus preventing Rb phosphorylation and S-phase entry by decreasing PCNA expression ( XREF_FIG ). We moreover found that citreoviridin alone and in combination with bortezomib augmented only p21, whereas p53 and p27 were unaltered, showing that these two CKIs were not involved in citreoviridin- or bortezomib-induced cell cycle arrest ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nThe proteasome inhibitor bortezomib enhanced citreoviridin-induced UPR and cytoplasmic vacuolation.\n\nNext, we demonstrated that the combination of citreoviridin and bortezomib enhanced the UPR by increasing PERK, IRE1alpha, and calnexin expression, as well as eIF2alpha phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination ( XREF_FIG ). As the treatment period advanced to 5 days, we observed that prolonged UPR caused massive cytoplasmic vacuolation in the combined and bortezomib treatments ( XREF_FIG ). The number of formed cytoplasmic vacuoles was higher in the combined treatment compared with that in the treatment with single agent or vehicle control. The results suggest that the combination of citreoviridin and bortezomib might induce non-apoptotic cell death, as highlighted by the cytoplasmic vacuolation.\n\n\n\nBoth purinergic receptor signaling and UPR but not calcium influx are involved in citreoviridin-caused cell death.\n\nTo investigate the influences of purinergic receptor signaling and UPR on citreoviridin-inhibited cell proliferation, ATP and chemical chaperone were applied after and prior to drug treatment, respectively. Citreoviridin-inhibited proliferation was partially recovered by ATP posttreatment and tauroursodeoxycholic acid pretreatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The involvement of extracellular ATP on P2Y ATP-gated ion channel was further investigated. We utilized calcium indicator to monitor the kinetics of calcium influx and found that the addition of citreoviridin or bortezomib did not change the intracellular calcium ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) and affect the ATP-boosted calcium influx ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). This evidence suggests that citreoviridin and bortezomib did not regulate the PM calcium regulators or desensitize the ATP-induced calcium influx in 24-h treatment.\n\n\n\nCombination of bortezomib and citreoviridin caused caspase-independent cell death.\n\nNext, we revealed that the combination of citreoviridin and bortezomib caused cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), activation of caspase 7, decrease in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and increase in Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) ( XREF_FIG ). However, we did not observe the typical apoptotic phenotype including phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), nuclear condensation (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining in  XREF_FIG ), and hypodiploid DNA content ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), suggesting that the combined treatment did not cause apoptotic cell death. We then showed that cell death induced by citreoviridin and bortezomib was not prevented by co-incubation of MCF7 cells with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk or with caspase 3/7 inhibitor ( XREF_FIG ). These results indicate that non-apoptotic cell death induced by the combination of citreoviridin and bortezomib is caspase independent.\n\n\n\nCombination of bortezomib and citreoviridin caused autophagy-independent cellular vacuolization and cell death.\n\nThe UPR is highly connected to autophagy owing to high demand of metabolism. To examine whether the citreoviridin and bortezomib caused cell death is mediated by autophagy, we detected the protein levels of major components sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B) for autophagosome formation. The levels of SQSTM1 and LC3B were markedly induced by starvation in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS), while only slightly affected by citreoviridin and bortezomib ( XREF_FIG ). We also demonstrated that the citreoviridin- and bortezomib-induced cell death was not rescued by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and wortmannin ( XREF_FIG ), indicating that PI3K activity is not required for citreoviridin- and bortezomib-inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, both citreoviridin and bortezomib did not induce LC3 puncta in contrast to the incremental number of LC3 puncta when cells exposed to bafilomycin A1 ( XREF_FIG ), indicating the treatment has no effect on autophagy. Our results also demonstrated that the formation of cellular vacuolation was not affected by pretreatment of PI3K inhibitors ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting the citreoviridin- and bortezomib-caused cytoplasmic vacuolization is independent of PI3K-mediated autophagy.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nEctopic ATP synthases on the surface of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and adipocytes have been revealed to regulate cholesterol uptake, angiogenesis, extracellular ATP signaling in wound healing, and preadipocyte differentiation, respectively. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  The significance of ectopic ATP synthase in normal cells and cancer research has been emphasized in the past decades. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  The expression of ectopic ATP synthase on cancer cells was first discovered in hematological cancer, the chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. It acts as a ligand for developing effectors of native natural killer and interleukin 2-activated killer cells in the cytolytic pathway. 38  In the present study, we found first evidence that oxidative phosphorylation complexes, including F 1 F o  ATP synthase and ETC complexes, were ectopically expressed on the PM of breast cancer cells ( XREF_FIG ). The absence of ectopic ATP synthase on the non-tumorigenic breast epithelium cells MCF10A indicates the potent role of ectopic ATP synthase in targeted therapy. The ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin, which targets the ATP synthase beta subunit and inhibits ATP synthesis activity, dramatically reduced proliferation of breast cancer cells and retained the viability of non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that ectopic ATP synthase might be crucial for the proliferation of cancer cells. Cancer cells utilize glucose rapidly and efficiently to support their unlimited growth and to develop intense switches and alterations in fundamental metabolism. Whether ectopic expression of mitochondrial proteins on the PM is involved in the dysregulation of tumor metabolism and bioenergetics in mitochondria remains unclear.\n\nAccumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, nutrient deprivation, calcium imbalance, oxidative stress, metabolic alterations, and environmental acidity activate UPR signaling to enable adaptation to perturbations and to relieve ER stress. 39  Citreoviridin inhibited cell proliferation, reduced colony formation, and caused cell cycle arrest by inducing the UPR ( XREF_FIG , XREF_FIG , XREF_FIG ). This suggests the inhibition of cellular interruptions coupled to ectopic ATP synthase and therefore links the function of ectopic ATP synthase to the regulation of metabolic homeostasis in cancer cells.\n\nAs a double-edged sword, activation of UPR can lead to conflicting consequences for tumorigenesis. 40  In response to the initial expansion of the tumor population, the UPR activates cytoprotective signaling pathways that alleviate ER stress and enhance the folding capacity to cope with excess protein production and an extreme redox environment. 40  Angiogenesis is thus stimulated by inadequate nutrients and oxygen and is potentiated by UPR-modulated hypoxia-induced factor-1 to activate the vascular endothelial growth factor. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  However, prolonged UPR ultimately induces cell death associated with ER stress, typically through apoptosis dependent on or independent of C/EBP homologous protein to remove overstressed cells. 43  As the ER stress response has both protective and destructive elements, fully characterizing which branches and downstream components of the UPR are activated in tumors is essential. 40 \n\nIn parallel with the attenuation of translation and increase in chaperons, UPR signaling also activates ERAD by using the 26S proteasome for degradation of unfolded proteins. Results of our proteomic analysis showed that the identified 26S protease regulatory subunit 7 was downregulated in citreoviridin-treated cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). The 26S proteasome system that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in an ATP-dependent manner is composed of 20S stacked core rings and 19S regulatory particles. 44  PSMC2, a part of the 19S regulatory complex, is responsible for degrading ubiquitinated substrates into the 20S proteasome, and its expression is essential for 19S and 26S proteasome assembly. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Therefore, the decrease in the 26S protease regulatory subunit 7 reduced proteasome activity and sensitized the cancer cells toward cell death. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR \n\nAs citreoviridin induced UPR, caused cell cycle arrest, and reduced cell proliferation but did not cause cell death, we then aimed to strengthen the inhibitory efficacy by testing a combined treatment. We hypothesized that irreversible ER stress could switch from signaling pathways orchestrated by cellular adaption to a dead end. To explore the role of ER stress in anticancer therapy, we combined the UPR-inducing ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin and the 26S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Both UPR signaling and cell cycle regulators were affected by the combined treatment.\n\nTo understand the regulation of the combined treatment on cell cycle progression, we examined the expression of cell cycle regulators in G 0 /G 1 , S, and G 2 /M phases. Combination with bortezomib inhibited the citreoviridin-induced compensation of cyclin D 3 /CDK6, preventing Rb phosphorylation and S-phase entry by decreasing PCNA expression ( XREF_FIG ). CDK1/cyclin B acted as the M-phase promoting factor controlling the onset of mitosis. The activity of CDK1/cyclin B is controlled by the level and localization of cyclin B and by the regulatory phosphorylation of CDK1. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Activation of CDK1/cyclin B is precisely regulated by its two feed-forward loops, namely, dephosphorylation of phosphorylated phosphatase Cdc25C and inhibition of Wee1 kinase. 49  CDK1 is inactivated by Tyr15 and Thr14 phosphorylation of Wee1 and is activated by Cdc25C through dephosphorylation of Tyr15 and phosphorylation of Thr161. 50  Here we demonstrated that induction of phosphorylation on Thr161 and Tyr15 of CDK1 and the expression of cyclin B and Cdc25C were diminished in response to the combined treatment compared with bortezomib alone. This result is similar to that of the citreoviridin treatment ( XREF_FIG ) and accounts for the observation of accumulated populations in both G 2 /M and G 0 /G 1  phases in response to combined treatment ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nExcessive ER stress leads to apoptotic cell death. 51  Our results indicate that prolonged ER stress caused cell toxicity ( XREF_FIG ), inhibited colony formation ( XREF_FIG ), induced cleavage of PARP and caspase 7 ( XREF_FIG ), and decreased the Bcl2/Bax ratio ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting the triggering of apoptosis. However, typical apoptotic phenotypes, including nucleus condensation ( XREF_FIG ), an increase in the sub-G 1  population in cell cycle due to DNA fragmentation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), and exposure of PS on the cell surface ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), did not occur. Furthermore, we observed that the combined treatment caused unconventional cytoplasmic vacuolation ( XREF_FIG ), and caspase- and autophagy- independent cell death ( XREF_FIG ), implying that a novel type of cell death occurred. Methuosis, a novel form of non-apoptotic cell death characterized by the accumulation of vacuoles derived from macropinosomes and endosomes, was discovered and defined by Overmeyer et al. 52  in 2008. Our findings in the combination treatment leading to cytoplasmic vacuolation were consistent with the morphology of glioblastoma cells overexpressing constitutive-activated RAS, which leads to methuosis. These indicate that the combination of citreoviridin and bortezomib induced methuosis-like cell death. Recently, numerous adaptive mechanisms of ER stress-induced autophagy, a process regulating homeostasis of cellular nutrients by protein and organelle turnover, have been found to contribute to the development of oncogenic properties, drug resistance in cancer therapy, and pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Furthermore, a quantitative proteomics study demonstrated that the in vivo anticancer activity of citreoviridin was due to the glucose metabolism switch, 54  suggesting that citreoviridin-induced UPR might be involved in glucose metabolism. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Whether a relationship exists between ER stress and macropinocytosis leading to methuosis remains unknown.\n\nIn addition to ERAD, the activated UPR stimulate autophagy. 1  Protein quality control is governed by two main processes: proteasomal degradation and autophagy. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  Inhibition of proteasome degradation by bortezomib therefore forced the escalation of autophagy flux ( XREF_FIG ), which is consistent with previous findings in myelomas. XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  However, the use of autophagy inhibitors could not confer the citreoviridin- and bortezomib-caused cytotoxicity or cytoplasmic vacuolization ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting the elevated autophagy is a minor effect along with the drug treatment. Furthermore, the perinuclear distribution of LC3B was not colocalized with the enlarged vacuoles ( XREF_FIG ), indicating the cellular vacuolization is independent of formation of autophagosome.\n\nIn summary, our findings highlight that ectopic oxidative phosphorylation complexes are present on the PM and that ectopic ATP synthase could serve as a potential anticancer target. Our results show that the ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin could inhibit cancer cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest in the G 0 /G 1  phase through activation of the UPR. An increase in ER stress caused by the 26S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which blocks ERAD, and citreoviridin, which targets ectopic ATP synthase, eventually resulted in non-apoptotic cell death combined with severe cytoplasmic vacuolation. With the aid of pharmaceutical proteomics and protein-protein interaction network analysis, we obtained evidence that combined therapy of inhibitors targeted collective pathways that were functionally integrated. This finding suggests that application of the combined therapy might influence diverse cellular responses and produce a coordinated outcome.\n\n",
