      "text":"Interaction of cCMP with the cGK, cAK and MAPK Kinases in Murine Tissues.\n\n\n\ncAMP and cGMP are well established second messengers that are essential for numerous (patho)physiological processes. These purine cyclic nucleotides activate cAK and cGK, respectively. Recently, the existence of cCMP was described, and a possible function for this cyclic nucleotide was investigated. It was postulated that cCMP plays a role as a second messenger. However, the functions regulated by cCMP are mostly unknown. To elucidate probable functions, cCMP-binding and -activated proteins were identified using different methods. We investigated the effect of cCMP on purified cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases and lung and jejunum tissues of wild type (WT), cGKI-knockout (cGKI KO) and cGKII-knockout (cGKII KO) mice. The catalytic activity of protein kinases was measured by a (gamma- 32 P) ATP kinase assay. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (cAK, cGKI and cGKII) in WT tissue lysates were stimulated by cCMP. In contrast, there was no stimulation of phosphorylation in KO tissue lysates. Competitive binding assays identified cAK, cGKI, and cGKII as cCMP-binding proteins. An interaction between cCMP/MAPK and a protein-protein complex of MAPK/cGK were detected via cCMP affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. These complexes were abolished or reduced in jejunum tissues from cGKI KO or cGKII KO mice. In contrast, these complexes were observed in the lung tissues from WT, cGKI KO and cGKII KO mice. Moreover, cCMP was also able to stimulate the phosphorylation of MAPK. These results suggest that MAPK signaling is regulated by cGMP-dependent protein kinases upon activation by cCMP. Based on these results, we propose that additional cCMP-dependent protein kinases that are capable of modulating MAPK signaling could exist. Hence, cCMP could potentially act as a second messenger in the cAK/cGK and MAPK signaling pathways and play an important role in physiological processes of the jejunum and lung.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe principle of cyclic nucleotides as intracellular signaling molecules is well established in regard to the purinergic cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). However, more recent data has suggested that the pyrimidinic cyclic nucleotides cyclic cytidine monophosphate (cCMP) and cyclic uridine monophosphate (cUMP) might also exert an intracellular function. These cyclic nucleotides can be synthesized in eukaryotic cells by soluble nucleotidyl cyclases, such as soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) or soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, the synthesis of pyrimidinic cyclic nucleotides has been detected in bacterial cells (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and was shown to be stimulated by bacterial toxins (e.g., edema factor) [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. These observations raise the question of whether possible target proteins and/or effector systems of these cyclic nucleotides exist. Therefore, studies have sought to elucidate a possible role for these cyclic nucleotides as intracellular second messengers [ XREF_BIBR ]. cCMP activates purified cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI) isoforms cGKIalpha and cGKIbeta, cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Additionally, exogenous application of cCMP induced cGK-mediated modulation of vascular relaxation, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation via cGMP-kinase I was detected using transgenic mice [ XREF_BIBR ]. The binding of cCMP to cAKRIalpha (a regulatory subunit of cAK) was observed in mammalian cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, to date it is not known whether cCMP can function as an intracellular messenger molecule in vivo. A critical point is whether the concentration of cCMP in vivo is sufficient to activate the identified signaling proteins. Moreover, a selective signaling pathway for cCMP has not yet been demonstrated. Although cCMP could act via pathways that are usually activated by other cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP/cGMP, further downstream effectors may exist. Moreover, the stimuli inducing cCMP synthesis could differ from those of the other cyclic nucleotide systems, and therefore a specific role for cCMP could be elucidated. Hence, the discovery of further cCMP targets is important for the identification of probable cCMP functions. To elucidate possible targets of cCMP in tissues, we performed cCMP kinase activity assays and cCMP-affinity chromatography of lung or intestinal murine tissues and analyzed the relevant proteins using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting analysis. These tissues were selected because cGKI and/or cGKII are present in high concentrations. cGKI was originally purified from lung (which contains high amounts of cGKI) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ], intestinal tissues including jejunum contain high concentrations of cGKI and cGKII [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. We confirmed that cGKI and cAK are cCMP-interacting proteins, and identified cGKII and MAPK as possible cCMP signaling molecules.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nActivation of cyclic nucleotide dependent kinases by cCMP in vitro and in tissues.\n\nIn previous studies, we showed that cCMP is able to stimulate purified cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases cAK and cGKI [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Based on these results, we used VASPtide (RRKVSKQE) as a well-established peptide substrate for the determination of cGKI and cAK stimulation. To confirm that cCMP activates kinases and to investigate whether this activation is dependent on the substrate used, we performed (gamma- 32 P) ATP kinase assays using purified protein kinases and a novel substrate peptide called IRAGtide (RRRVSVAV) that contains serine 696 as the identified cGKI phosphorylation site of IRAG [ XREF_BIBR ].  XREF_FIG  demonstrates that both cGKI isoforms ( XREF_FIG ) and cAK ( XREF_FIG , K a (cCMP): 71+/-11 muM) could be activated by cCMP in a concentration dependent manner. The K a (cCMP) for cGKIalpha and cGKIbeta were 26+/-6 muM and 70+/-5 muM, respectively. Furthermore, cCMP stimulated the activation of cGKII [K a (cCMP): 110+/-8 muM]. Therefore, both VASPtide and IRAGtide are suitable peptide substrates for the kinase assays. Interestingly, the measured kinase activation differed slightly between the substrate peptides. This result suggests that substrate specificity for these kinases is mediated by peptide sequences not integrated into the phosphorylated consensus sequence.\n\nThe next step was to examine whether cCMP could stimulate endogenous cGKs in jejunum and lung tissue lysates. Both tissue types are known to contain cGKs in high concentrations [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Wild-type (WT) and cGKI-knockout (KO) tissue lysates were prepared, and kinase assays were performed as described above. A cAK-inhibitor peptide (AS 5-24 ) was added to eliminate cAK phosphorylation. Treatment of WT tissue lysates with cCMP (100 muM) resulted in a 2- to 2.5-fold stimulation compared with water alone (ctrl) ( XREF_FIG ). Comparable results were achieved using VASPtide and IRAGtide as the substrate peptides. Interestingly this stimulation of phosphorylation was not detectable in cGKI KO tissue lysates, indicating that cCMP-dependent phosphorylation occurs via cGKI in jejunum and lung tissues. To relate these cCMP mediated effects to cAMP and cGMP we performed (gamma- 32 P) ATP kinase assays using increasing cAMP or cGMP concentrations (1 nM-50 mM).  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  shows the activation of kinases at various cNMP concentrations in WT and cGKI KO tissues (lung or jejunum) using the two different substrate peptides. Interestingly the cGMP mediated stimulation of kinases in WT tissue is almost comparable to the cCMP mediated effect, resulting in a 1.8 to 2.8fold stimulation of endogenous kinases ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY / XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  Fig). The effect of cGMP in WT tissue lysates was completely abolished in cGKI KO tissue lysates as previously observed with cCMP. cAMP enhanced phosphorylation of kinases in WT lung tissue lysate but not in jejunum WT or cGKI KO tissue ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY / XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  Fig). As a cAK inhibitor peptide (AS 5-24 ) was added to eliminate cAK phosphorylation, a crossreaction with other kinases is possible. In these experiments the kinases in jejunum WT tissue possessed a ~70fold lower K a  value (2+/-0.5 muM) for cGMP ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) than for cCMP (140+/-35 muM) ( XREF_FIG ), using IRAGtide as peptide substrate. This fact suggests that higher concentrations of cCMP (relative to cGMP) may be required in vivo to activate endogenous kinases. The affinity of cCMP for cGKs is much lower than that of cGMP.\n\n\n\nIdentification of cCMP-binding proteins.\n\nTo illuminate the exact role of cCMP, we sought to identify proteins that interact with this cyclic nucleotide. Therefore, lung and jejunum WT tissue lysates were analyzed by cCMP-affinity chromatography and gel electrophoresis of the bound proteins, followed by silver staining ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) or Western blotting (Fig  XREF_FIG / XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY / XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  Fig). cCMP was added (+) or omitted (-) during the affinity chromatography experiments to investigate the specificity of the binding. The concentration of 200 muM ( XREF_FIG ) or 2 mM cCMP ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) was equally used. Using mass spectrometry of silver-stained gel bands, the cGKIalpha (76 kDa) and cAKIIalpha (50 kDa)/Ialpha (47 kDa) reg (regulatory subunits) were identified as cCMP-binding proteins ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). This binding was verified using Western blotting analysis with the specific primary antibodies cGKIcommon, cGKII and cAKRIalpha/beta, using a more physiological cCMP concentration (200 muM).  XREF_FIG  shows the corresponding immunoblots obtained using lung WT tissue lysate. Interactions between cGKI/cCMP and cGKII/cCMP were also detected in jejunum tissue ( XREF_FIG ). Specific binding of cCMP to cAKRIalpha/beta was also detected. As previously reported [ XREF_BIBR ], we also performed this experiment with 2 mM cCMP ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY / XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY Fig); the effect was the same except that the signals were stronger than with 200 muM cCMP. Furthermore we checked if other cyclic nucleotides, such as cAMP (2 mM) overcome the interaction between cCMP and kinases, such as cGKI, but there was no specific interaction ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).Hence, cCMP interacts with both cGK and cAK in the analyzed tissues. Comparable results were obtained using jejunum WT tissue lysate.\n\n\n\nInteraction of MAPK with cGK.\n\nWhile searching for other cCMP-interacting proteins, we found several publications that postulated a possible role for cyclic nucleotides and protein kinases interacting with the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, we analyzed whether cCMP interfered with MAPK signaling and detected an interaction between cCMP and p44/42 MAPK. The binding was specific in jejunum ( XREF_FIG ) and lung ( XREF_FIG ) WT tissues, because the addition of an excess of cyclic nucleotide (200 muM cCMP) resulted in the loss of the association of MAPK with the cCMP affinity matrix. Particularly, the p42 MAPK isoform was precipitated in experiments using 200 muM cCMP ( XREF_FIG ) or 2 mM cCMP ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). To determine whether cGK was essential for this interaction, we performed several competition experiments using tissues from KO mice. MAPK was precipitated from lung cGKI KO and cGKII KO tissues in the same manner as WT tissue ( XREF_FIG ). In contrast, specific binding was only observed using cGKII KO samples in the jejunum tissues ( XREF_FIG ). Working with 2 mM cCMP the same result was achieved ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Interestingly, MAPK was not precipitated from the jejunum cGKI KO tissue lysate ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nNext, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation to detect a possible protein-protein interaction between cGK and MAPK ( XREF_FIG ). MAPK was precipitated using the cGKIalpha and cGKII antibodies, indicating an interaction between MAPK, cGK and the cyclic nucleotides. We also performed precipitation studies using 8-AET-cGMP agarose and 200 muM cGMP was added (indicated with +) or omitted (indicated with-). Interestingly, no specific interaction of MAPK with cGMP agarose was detected, both in lung and jejunum WT tissue ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nNext, we analyzed whether tissue phosphorylation of MAPK was influenced by the addition of the cyclic nucleotide cCMP, and found that the phosphorylation of MAPK was stimulated when 100 muM DB-cCMP was added to the WT tissue lysate for 15-60 min. As a control, an unstimulated tissue lysate was analyzed and compared with the stimulated samples. The control samples (us) were treated identically to the DB-cCMP stimulated samples except that water was added instead of DB-cCMP water. Treatment of lung WT tissue lysate ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) with DB-cCMP for 15 min resulted in ~2.5-fold stimulation of p42 MAPK phosphorylation compared to the control, while treatment for 60 min resulted in ~6-fold stimulation. p44 MAPK phosphorylation was less pronounced, but remained significant; the phosphorylation was increased ~2-fold after 15 min of stimulation and ~4-fold after 1 h. The same trend was observed in jejunum WT tissue lysate ( XREF_FIG ), with ~13.5-fold stimulation of p42 MAPK phosphorylation after 15 min of stimulation and ~2.5-fold stimulation of p44 MAPK phosphorylation in the same time frame. After stimulation for 60 min, the p44 MAPK phosphorylation level increased to ~8-fold, while the p42 MAPK phosphorylation level stayed the same. In comparison to lung tissue, phosphorylation of MAPK in jejunum tissue was significantly stronger ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In both lung and jejunum tissue, MAPK phosphorylation could be stimulated by cCMP. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of MAPK was inhibited by the addition of the PKA inhibitor AS 5-24 , suggesting a stimulatory function for PKA in cCMP-mediated MAPK phosphorylation. There is a need for further studies analyzing MAPK activation by other cyclic nucleotides. To elucidate the role of cGK in lung and jejunum tissues in this process, we used cGKII knockout (cGKII KO) and cGKI knockout (cGKI KO) mice. The experiment was conducted as described above (the same experiment using WT tissue). We detected phosphorylation both in the jejunum and lung tissues from cGKI KO and cGKII KO mice ( XREF_FIG ,  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). It is interesting to note that the phosphorylation in the jejunum cGKII KO tissue was significantly increased when compared with the WT and cGKI KO tissues; in these tissues, stimulation with 100 muM DB-cCMP for 15 min led to a ~14-fold increase in phosphorylation compared to the unstimulated control, whereas in WT jejunum tissue the increase was only ~6-fold. Interestingly, this effect was not observed in lung tissues. In summary, these results suggest an inhibitory role for cGKII in cCMP-induced MAPK phosphorylation in the jejunum.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn this study, we used cCMP kinase activity assays and affinity chromatography to identify cGKII and MAPK as possible cCMP effector molecules, and confirmed that cGKI and cAK function as cCMP interactors. The activation of the kinase activity of the cGKI isoforms in addition to cGKII and cAK by cCMP using IRAGtide as a substrate is in agreement with previously published data [ XREF_BIBR ]. Interestingly, although the IRAG protein is a specific substrate for cGKIbeta, cGKIalpha phosphorylation was more effective compared to cGKIbeta when IRAGtide was used as the substrate. This result indicates that the substrate specificity resulted from an IRAG-cGKIbeta interaction site located outside of the kinase domain [ XREF_BIBR ]. Our observations implied that cCMP might modulate diverse tissue functions. The confirmation of the presence of cCMP and cUMP using HPLC and mass spectrometry suggested that the concentrations of these cyclic nucleotides in cells strongly varied [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, the stimulation of cyclic nucleotide synthesis may diverge in different cells and tissues. Furthermore, effects on different signaling pathways could be exerted in distinct tissues. For example, HCN channels could be modulated by cCMP [ XREF_BIBR ]. In this study, we determined that target proteins of cCMP were present in several tissues, including the lung and jejunum. In addition to the recently established cCMP-binding proteins cGKI and cAKRI, we identified cGKII and MAPK as possible signaling proteins that interact with cCMP. This finding broadens the functions of cCMP. cCMP acts as a signaling molecule; therefore, cCMP might alternatively modulate both the cGK and cAK signaling pathways by acting as a non-canonical second messenger. Interestingly, in previous studies both cCMP and cUMP were detected in the gastric mucosa, indicating a probable function for these molecules in the gastrointestinal tract [ XREF_BIBR ]. The identification of diverse effectors of cCMP could lead to the discovery of its possible roles in the signaling pathways of diverse tissues. For example, cGKI is strongly involved in the relaxation processes. Previously, the role of cCMP via cGKI in vascular relaxation was elucidated using cGKI-knockout mice [ XREF_BIBR ]. Our results investigating the role of cCMP in intestinal and lung tissues may indicate that relaxation in these tissues is inter alia regulated by cCMP. The role of cCMP/cGKII in these tissues would most likely be involved in intestinal secretion or lung alveolar fluid clearance [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. As previously discussed [ XREF_BIBR ], cCMP/cAKRI regulates a large variety of cellular processes. However, its role in vivo might be less important than that recently described in an investigation into CREB-phosphorylation in S49 lymphoma cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. MAPK stimulation of cAK via Ras/Raf has been demonstrated [ XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, cCMP may activate MAPK phosphorylation by cAK via a similar signaling pathway. Our results support this stimulatory effect of cAMP/cAK. However, other reports have described the inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation by cAMP/cAK via Rap1 [ XREF_BIBR ]. The newly discovered correlation of cCMP/cGK with MAPK could indicate a role in cellular proliferation. However, this is a highly controversial topic because it is unclear whether cGKI functions in a proliferative or anti-proliferative fashion, and it is not clear how cGKI modulates the signaling of MAPK. Endogenous cGK has been reported to reverse EGF-induced MAPK signaling and thereby inhibit cellular proliferation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. However, these authors reported that the reduced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK by cGMP occurred in a manner that was reversible using a PKG or PKC inhibitor. Additionally, an active role for NO/cGMP/cGKIalpha on MAPK phosphatase MKP-1 was previously reported in insulin-treated vascular smooth muscle cells [ XREF_BIBR ], and another report showed that p42/p44 MAPK was a potential target of cGKI in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, thereby inducing cellular proliferation [ XREF_BIBR ]. There are also divergent results concerning whether MAPK signaling is activated or inhibited by the cGKII isoform. cGKII was shown to inhibit MAPK signaling induced by growth factors, and thereby interfere with the cellular proliferation and migration of breast and gastric cancer cells, respectively [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Our results support a suppressive role for cGKII on MAPK phosphorylation and an inhibitory function on this signaling pathway. cGKII is more strongly expressed in the jejunum than the lung. This finding might explain the reason that this effect was associated with the jejunum tissue lysates. Regardless, the mechanism of action of cGKII is not clear and needs to be elucidated in future studies. It might be possible that MAPK phosphatases are involved or directly targeted by cGKII. However, other reports have suggested that intestinal cell proliferation might be stimulated by guanylyl cyclase via cGKII/MAPK [ XREF_BIBR ]. Here, we showed that a complex of cGKI/MAPK or cGKII/MAPK may be activated by cCMP. However, how this complex is formed and whether adaptor proteins are necessary to assemble this kinase complex is unknown. It would be interesting to discover whether these complexes regulate cellular processes in diverse tissues. Further studies are necessary to elucidate these mechanisms and to establish the probable cellular functions of cCMP effector proteins.\n\n",
