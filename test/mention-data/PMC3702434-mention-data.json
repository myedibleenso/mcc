      "text":"EpCAM overexpression prolongs proliferative capacity of primary human breast epithelial cells and supports hyperplastic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) has been shown to be strongly expressed in human breast cancer and cancer stem cells and its overexpression has been supposed to support tumor progression and metastasis. However, effects of EpCAM overexpression on normal breast epithelial cells have never been studied before. Therefore, we analyzed effects of transient adenoviral overexpression of EpCAM on proliferation, migration and differentiation of primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs).\n\n\n\nMethods.\n\nHMECs were transfected by an adenoviral system for transient overexpression of EpCAM. Thereafter, changes in cell proliferation and migration were studied using a real time measurement system. Target gene expression was evaluated by transcriptome analysis in proliferating and polarized HMEC cultures. A Chicken Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) xenograft model was used to study effects on in vivo growth of HMECs.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\nEpCAM overexpression in HMECs did not significantly alter gene expression profile of proliferating or growth arrested cells. Proliferating HMECs displayed predominantly glycosylated EpCAM isoforms and were inhibited in cell proliferation and migration by upregulation of p27 KIP1  and p53. HMECs with overexpression of EpCAM showed a down regulation of E-cadherin. Moreover, cells were more resistant to TGF-beta1 induced growth arrest and maintained longer capacities to proliferate in vitro. EpCAM overexpressing HMECs xenografts in chicken embryos showed hyperplastic growth, lack of lumen formation and increased infiltrates of the chicken leukocytes.\n\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nEpCAM revealed oncogenic features in normal human breast cells by inducing resistance to TGF-beta1-mediated growth arrest and supporting a cell phenotype with longer proliferative capacities in vitro. EpCAM overexpression resulted in hyperplastic growth in vivo. Thus, we suggest that EpCAM acts as a prosurvival factor counteracting terminal differentiation processes in normal mammary glands.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nEpCAM (also known as 17-1A, GA733-2, KSA, ESA, and EGP-40) is a homophilic, calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule of 39-42kDa [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] expressed on most normal and cancerous epithelial tissues, cancer stem cells, embryonic stem cells and germ cells [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. EpCAM is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the TACSTD1 gene. The EpCAM protein contains an extracellular domain (EpEX) with a nidogen-like domain as well as thyroglobulin- and epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular domain (EpICD) consisting of 26 amino acids. EpCAM has been shown to be expressed on normal epithelial cells in situ at intercellular basolateral interfaces [ XREF_BIBR ]. In regard to its function, it has been shown in the developing zebrafish, that EpCAM-lacking mutants display defects both in epithelial morphogenesis and epithelial integrity [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, mutants show abnormal skin development with higher infection susceptibility and enhanced skin inflammation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In regard to mammals, EpCAM -/-  mice die in uterus at embryonic day 12, are developmentally delayed and display prominent placental abnormalities [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn tumor development and progression EpCAM has a controversial biological role [ XREF_BIBR ]. As an adhesion molecule, EpCAM mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion interactions thereby preventing metastasis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In colorectal cancer EpCAM appears to act as molecule with protective function, since EpCAM deletions result in a higher risk to develop cancer [ XREF_BIBR ] and overexpression of EpCAM in colorectal cancer cells has been shown to inhibit metastasis and invasion of tumor xenografts in mice [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that EpCAM can abrogate E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion thereby promoting metastasis [ XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, it has been shown that EpCAM overexpression in cancer cells can support proliferation by enhancing Wnt signaling [ XREF_BIBR ]. In breast carcinoma patients, high EpCAM expression was observed in less differentiated tumors [ XREF_BIBR ] and was associated with larger tumors, nodal metastasis and worse survival of patients [ XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, high EpCAM expression correlated with poor prognosis in both node positive and node negative disease [ XREF_BIBR ]. Due to its high expression in breast cancer tissue, EpCAM has emerged as an attractive target for treatment of breast cancer patients and recent studies with the humanized EpCAM antibody Adecatumumab showed already promising results in patients with EpCAM overexpression [ XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, the approval by the European Union in 2009 of the EpCAM-specific antibody Catumaxomab, adds a therapeutic option also in breast cancer patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nAlthough it has been shown that EpCAM is expressed in normal epithelial cells [ XREF_BIBR ] the role in normal breast tissue homeostasis is still unclear. In this study we analyzed effects of adenoviral overexpression of EpCAM on growth, migration and differentiation of normal breast epithelial cells. Moreover, we screened for genes altered by overexpression of EpCAM in normal epithelial cells of the breast and analyzed in vivo growth in a chicken xenograft model.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nExpression of EpCAM in normal breast tissue and primary human mammary epithelial cells.\n\nIn the mammary gland all epithelial cells express EpCAM with the exception of myoepithelial cells. There were no significant changes in immunoreactivity between luminal and basal cells                    . In clear contrast to all tumor samples analyzed, normal polarized epithelia had a strict localization of EpCAM on the basolateral membrane. This basolateral expression got lost in tumor cells of primary breast carcinoma and metastasis which showed clearly localization on the entire cell surface (Additional file  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY : Figure S1). Primary epithelial cells from healthy breast tissue (HMECs) were analyzed for their phenotype by a panel of markers specific for myoepithelial (ASMA), progenitor (p63), basal (CK5/14) and luminal (CK18) epithelial cells. As expected, all HMECs lacked luminal (CK18-) or myoepithelial (ASMA-) markers, but displayed more a basal phenotype (p63-, CK5/14+). Interestingly, in vitro cultivated HMECs were negative for EpCAM in the immunofluorescence analysis                    , although low transcript levels could be detected by qPCR analysis (data not shown).\n\n\n\nAdenoviral overexpression of EpCAM inhibited cell proliferation and migration in HMECs.\n\nBased on our observations that HMECs display low endogenous EpCAM expression in 2-dimensional cultures, we overexpressed the putative EpCAM oncogene and analyzed effects on cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 viruses/cell we obtained a strong EpCAM expression in HMECs                     without any effects on cell viability (Additional file  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY : Figure S2B). Noteworthy, next to the native EpCAM protein on plasma membrane (Additional file  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY : Figure S2A) we found a lot of immunoreactive EpCAM in cytoplasmic organelles in our immunofluorescence analysis (Additional file  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY : Figure S1D). These high amounts of cytoplasmic EpCAM might originate by overload of the intracellular vesicular traffic system with EpCAM or by a preferential detection of cytoplasmic EpCAM isoforms in our immunofuorescence analysis.\n\nA transient, about hundred-fold overexpression was obtained over the observed time period of 5days in all HMEC cultures                    . EpCAM overexpression in HMECs was also confirmed on protein level by Western Blot analysis                    . Interestingly, proliferating HMECs produced predominantly glycosylated isoforms (days 1 to 3), whereas in confluent and contact-inhibited cultures most of EpCAM protein was not glycosylated                    . The presence of different EpCAM isoforms in HMECs was confirmed by enzymatic deglycosylation experiments with the enzyme PNGaseF and subsequent Western Blot analysis                    . Under optimal mitotic stimulation EpCAM overexpression inhibited cell growth in proliferating HMECs as determined by the Real Time Cell Proliferation System                    . In comparison to control cells, EpCAM transfected cells showed elevated expression of the tumor suppressor genes, p27 Kip1  and p53                    . However, these changes were visible only as a post-transcriptional regulation, on the protein level. Gene expression levels of TP53 and p27 Kip1  did not significantly change after adenoviral transfection (Additionl file  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY : Figure S2C). EpCAM overexpression resulted also in a slight, but significant inhibition of cell migration as observed by the real time cell migration measurement                    .\n\n\n\nEpCAM expression is not induced by polarization processes in HMECs.\n\nAlthough EpCAM expression was strictly basolateral in breast epithelia in vivo, it was not expressed in our in vitro cultures of HMECs                    . Therefore, we concluded, that maintenance of cell polarity with functional tight- and gap- junctions is necessary for the expression of EpCAM and for further overexpression studies. HMECs were grown as mitotic cultures on collagen type I                     or as confluent, polarized monolayers on 0.4muM transwell inserts coated with Matrigel                    . Polarization of HMECs was controlled after 10days by measurement of transepithelial resistance (860 +/-50Omega) and by immunofluorescence stainings for the tight junction marker ZO-1, and cell-cell contacts mediated by E-cadherin and membranous beta-catenin. Cell-cell contact proteins E-cadherin and beta-catenin, molecular interaction partners of EpCAM, were strongly expressed in polarized HMECs cultures                    . However, we could not observe elevated EpCAM protein expression                    .\n\n\n\nEpCAM overexpression does not alter gene expression profile of HMECs.\n\nHMECs grown as polarized cultures or under mitotic culture conditions were adenovirally transfected to overexpress EpCAM/GFP or GFP. As expected, transient transfection resulted in a strong overexpression of EpCAM in comparison to control cells                    . Despite equal multiplicities of infection (MOI=100) used for all transfections, EpCAM overexpression was stronger in polarized cells than in standard culture conditions. Based on our data on EpCAM protein expression                     we isolated mRNA 24h after adenoviral transfection to identify genes directly regulated by EpCAM and not thereafter, by induction of the transcription factor p53. Apart from the clear overexpression of EpCAM, we did not observe any significant changes in the gene expression profile of HMECs under normal and polarized culture conditions                                                                      . These microarray data indicate that EpCAM overexpression alone does not directly affect gene transcription in HMECs either cultured in a polarized, tissue resembling culture model or under mitotic standard conditions.\n\n\n\nEpCAM antagonizes TGF-beta1 induced growth arrest.\n\nTGF-beta1 acts on epithelial cells as potent growth inhibitory factor and promotes differentiation processes. Basal cells stimulated with TGF-beta1 stop proliferation within 3days. In contrast to untreated control cells, displaying a small cell body and a strong light refracting morphology, TGF-beta1 treated cells changed morphology and acquired an enlarged and flat cell body                                    . After EpCAM overexpression, TGF-beta1 stimulated HMECs showed a higher percentage of cells with a small, strongly light-refracting morphology                            . Moreover, HMECs treated with TGF-beta1 underwent a terminal growth arrest and stained positively for senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal; Figure XREF_FIG B), a marker of cellular senescence. In clear contrast, upon simultaneously EpCAM overexpression, we could observe many cell clusters that were negative for SA-beta-Gal                             indicating that cells were not growth arrested and maintained a longer capacity to proliferate.\n\n\n\nEpCAM down regulates E-cadherin and prolongs proliferative lifespan of HMECs.\n\nLong term cultures of HMECs in culture medium containing TGF-beta1 were analyzed for differences between EpCAM/GFP and GFP overexpression. In the presence of the differentiation factor TGF-beta1 EpCAM overexpressing cells were still able to proliferate and formed bigger cell clusters after 6days in vitro                    . GFP transfected control cells stopped cell divisions after 3days and consisted predominantly of enlarged, flat and growth arrested cells                    . Analysis of cell numbers revealed a significant increase in cell counts in EpCAM overexpressing cells 6days after transfection                    .\n\nAdditionally, we analyzed a panel of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers to define the phenotype of EpCAM overexpressing cells. In particular, HMECs showed down regulation of E-cadherin after TGF-beta1 stimulation                                 . In clear contrast to GFP control cells, EpCAM-overexpressing cells showed an additional down regulation of E-cadherin                                 , which would explain the more spindle-shape phenotype of the cells                    . Another marker of EMT, vimentin expression, did not increase significantly after EpCAM overexpression in direct comparison to GFP transfected control cells                                 .\n\n\n\nEpCAM overexpressing HMECs form bigger xenografts consisting of p63 high  progenitor cells and lack luminal structure formation.\n\nBased on in vitro findings we analyzed effects of EpCAM overexpression in our in vivo model. Therefore, we transplanted HMEC xenografts onto chicken embryos to analyze in vivo growth                    . Chicken embryos have only innate immune responses and thus, tolerate growth of human cells. Transfected HMECs were transplanted as growth factor-reduced matrigel drops containing TGF-beta1. After 6days in vivo growth, xenografts became well vascularized and human onplants could be visualized by expression of GFP                    . Macroscopically, there were no significant changes in the size of HMEC onplants, however immunohistochemical analysis of invading cell clusters in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane tissue revealed morphological and quantitative differences. Cell clusters of GFP controls were smaller, less frequent and displayed significantly more lumen formation                                                        . In contrast, EpCAM overexpressing HMECs formed bigger structures, with more frequent disseminating cell clusters and therefore, almost no lumen formation                    . Higher cell numbers of EpCAM overexpressing HMEC grafts were also correlating with more p63 high  progenitor cells/high power field                    .\n\n\n\nEpCAM overexpression enhances cell proliferation in immortalized MCF-10A cells.\n\nBased on our observation that EpCAM overexpression alone is not enough to reveal its oncogenic features and that tumorigenesis is a multistep process, we decided to use the immortalized breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (p16 INK4a-/-)  for additional investigations. MCF10A cells can be efficiently transduced with adenovirus to overexpress EpCAM, but loose EpCAM expression faster than HMECs                    . In comparison to HMECs                    , MCF10A with EpCAM overexpression show an increased cell proliferation                     and upregulation of c-myc gene expression                    . Changes of c-myc expression could also be monitored on protein level                      .\n\nMoreover, MCF10A cell lines were generated by a lentiviral system to have a stable expression of a non-silencing control (ns/crtl) or an EpCAM specific (E#2) shRNA. Both cell lines, MCF10A  ns/crtl  and MCF10A  E#2 , were adenovirally transfected to overexpress GFP or EpCAM/GFP. In comparison to MCF10A  ns/crtl  cells MCF10A  E#2  cells were significantly downregulating EpCAM transcript levels 24 and 48h after adenoviral transfection                    . Real time cell proliferation of MCF10A  E#2  cells was significantly lower than those of MCF10A  ns/crtl  after adenoviral EpCAM overexpression                    . These data clearly indicate that EpCAM overexpression can enhance proliferation and c-myc levels in immortalized human breast epithelial cells.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nEpCAM is a widely described tumor-associated antigen, stem cell and cancer stem cell marker [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Cancer stem cells with a high EpCAM expression are considered to be more malignant and more prone to give metastasis than those with a low expression [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Although EpCAM overexpression in breast cancer is correlated with aggressive behavior and decreased overall survival of patients [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], functions and effects of EpCAM overexpression in normal mammary epithelial cells, i.e. healthy tissue have not been described so far.\n\nIn normal breast epithelia EpCAM has a strict basolateral expression. Among all epithelial cell-types only myoepithelial cells are EpCAM-negative [ XREF_BIBR ]. Tumor cells loosing cell-cell contacts and invading host tissue are also loosing the strict basolateral distribution of EpCAM and show more cytoplasmic and membranous staining [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Whether this is mediated by loss of cell polarity or by generation of translocated EpCAM isoforms is still under investigation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Recent studies showed that glycosylation of EpCAM might affect stability and function of the protein [ XREF_BIBR ]. Noteworthy, healthy tissue displays mainly weak expression of basic, not glycosylated EpCAM protein, whereas in tumor tissue, as well as in breast cancer cell lines, EpCAM is glycosylated and/or hyperglycosylated [ XREF_BIBR ]. Differences in glycosylation we could also observe between highly mitotic cultures and growth arrested monolayers of transfected human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs).\n\nIn vitro cultivated HMECs showed no EpCAM protein expression, although gene transcripts could be detected by qPCR in a low abundance. Presumably, these cells loose expression under artificial in vitro conditions and loss of normal tissue polarity, since in vivo both basal/progenitor as well as differentiated luminal cells are strongly positive for immunoreactive EpCAM. Moreover, cell-cell adhesions in our HMECs are primarily mediated by E-cadherin, which has been described to be a counter player of EpCAM [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Typically, HMEC cultures age under mitotic stress and induce p16 INK4A  and/or p53 [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Aberrant expression of oncogenes has been shown to induce cellular senescence (oncogene-induced senescence) by activation of the p53, p16/Rb or p27 Kip1  checkpoint. These check-points of the cellular senescence program protect cells from oncogenic signaling, prevent immortalization and acquisition of genomic instabilities [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] and are very often inactivated in cancer cells. In comparison to control cells, overexpression of EpCAM led to inhibition of proliferation and migration in HMECs. This represents a frequently observed reaction of normal cells to an oncogenic stimulus. However, in contrast to effects described for oncogenic ras or the catalytic subunit of the telomerase (TERT) we did not observe a complete growth arrest mediated by induction of p16 INK4A [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. EpCAM transfected HMECs are inhibited in cell proliferation, but do not undergo a terminal growth arrest. This might be due to simultaneous upregulation and accumulation of p53 and the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 . A crosstalk between EpCAM and p53 has already been reported [ XREF_BIBR ]. EpCAM gene expression is downregulated by p53 and loss of p53 leads to increased EpCAM expression and a more invasive phenotype in tumor cells [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\nEpCAM did not affect p53 or p27 Kip1  gene transcription, upregulations were only visible on the protein level. Thus, EpCAM might induce changes in p53 protein by affecting posttranscriptional modifications processes or protein stability [ XREF_BIBR ]. Moreover, p27 Kip1  has been shown to inhibit Rho-A driven cell migration processes [ XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, our HMECs upregulating p27 Kip1  after EpCAM overexpression probably showed an inhibition of cell migration despite down regulation of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin.\n\nAgainst our expectations, EpCAM expression alone did not directly affect transcription of other genes in our HMEC culture models, although a signaling pathway, directly activated by EpCAM cleavage, has been previously described in pharyngeal cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In fact, in HEK293 and FaDu tumor cell lines EpCAM has been reported to act directly on transcription of c-myc and cyclins[ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. We transfected growth arrested and polarized, as well as proliferating HMEC cultures and performed transcriptome analysis 24 h after overexpression of EpCAM. With this experimental approach we wanted to identify early genes directly regulated by EpCAM, before induction of the transcription factor p53 and its downstream genes. Both attempts gave no evidence that EpCAM overexpression is directly affecting gene expression profile of HMECs. Our data indicate that at least in primary HMECs overexpression of EpCAM, with absence of other oncogenes or mutations, has no immediate and direct effect on gene transcription. In fact, MCF10A, immortalized human epithelial cells having inactivation of the INK4A (p16) gene locus, respond to EpCAM overexpression by upregulating c-myc gene expression. Thus, we assume that other transforming stimuli have to act together with EpCAM to induce changes on gene transcription level.\n\nIn fact, EpCAM is primarily acting on cell-cell adhesion proteins such as E-cadherin, claudins, tetraspanins and CD44 [ XREF_BIBR ]. Changes on their protein levels, localization on the cell membrane and interactions, might affect intracellular signaling pathways and kinase activities. Indeed, it has been recently reported that EpCAM affects protein kinase C signaling and cell migration processes during gastrulation in xenopus embryos [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nHMECs are very sensitive to the cytokine TGF-beta1 treatment [ XREF_BIBR ]. This cytokine is able to inhibit cell proliferation and induce EMT differentiation processes in healthy epithelial cells [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. When HMECs are transfected to overexpress EpCAM many clones acquire resistance to TGF-beta1 induced growth arrest and display more spindle-shape phenotype. The underlying mechanism for increased resistance to TGF-beta1 mediated growth arrest still remains to be investigated. Further, our in vivo studies support the concept of EpCAM overexpression as supportive factor for hyperplastic growth. EpCAM overexpression together with TFG-beta1 and presumably other mitogenic factors present in Matrigel support hyperplastic growth and counteract growth arrest and terminal differentiation processes in vivo. We assume that HMECs with EpCAM overexpression gain longer proliferative capacities and acquire more resistances to growth inhibition due to activation of Wnt signaling. This increased stem cell signaling is supported by the observation that EpCAM overexpressing xenografts display an increased number of p63 +  undifferentiated progenitor cells. This is of particular interest, since higher amounts of undifferentiated cells in mammary gland contribute to increased risk to develop breast cancer [ XREF_BIBR ].\n\nMoreover, EpCAM overexpression leads to stronger innate immune responses in vivo. EpCAM overexpressing xenografts attracts more neutrophils from host tissue, which would suggest that EpCAM is supporting migration processes of immune cells as described previously for dentritic cells [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, further investigations are necessary to study effects of EpCAM expression on cancer cells in context of tumor immunology and microenvironment.\n\nThus, EpCAM overexpression might promote progression and metastasis of primary tumors. However, further studies are still needed to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for EpCAM overexpression in the context of TGF-beta/Wnt signaling and breast cancer development. This background will allow us to understand the impact of EpCAM overexpression on transformation of breast epithelial cells and growth of breast cancer cells.\n\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nEpCAM revealed oncogenic features in normal human breast cells, inducing resistance to TGF-beta1-mediated growth arrest and supporting a cell phenotype with longer proliferative capacities in vitro. EpCAM overexpression resulted in hyperplastic growth and enhanced innate immune responses in vivo. Thus, we suggest that EpCAM acts as a prosurvival factor counteracting terminal differentiation processes in normal mammary glands.\n\n\n\nEthical standards.\n\nThis study on commercially available tissue sections and primary cells and cell lines did not need approval of the local ethic committee of the Medical University of Innsbruck.
