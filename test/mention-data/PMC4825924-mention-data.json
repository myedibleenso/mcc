      "text":"Palmitoylation of the Cysteine Residue in the DHHC Motif of a Palmitoyl Transferase Mediates Ca 2+  Homeostasis in Aspergillus.\n\n\n\nFinely tuned changes in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2+ ] c ) mediate numerous intracellular functions resulting in the activation or inactivation of a series of target proteins. Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification involved in membrane protein trafficking between membranes and in their functional modulation. However, studies on the relationship between palmitoylation and calcium signaling have been limited. Here, we demonstrate that the yeast palmitoyl transferase ScAkr1p homolog, AkrA in Aspergillus nidulans, regulates [Ca 2+ ] c  homeostasis. Deletion of akrA showed marked defects in hyphal growth and conidiation under low calcium conditions which were similar to the effects of deleting components of the high-affinity calcium uptake system (HACS). The [Ca 2+ ] c  dynamics in living cells expressing the calcium reporter aequorin in different akrA mutant backgrounds were defective in their [Ca 2+ ] c  responses to high extracellular Ca 2+  stress or drugs that cause ER or plasma membrane stress. All of these effects on the [Ca 2+ ] c  responses mediated by AkrA were closely associated with the cysteine residue of the AkrA DHHC motif, which is required for palmitoylation by AkrA. Using the acyl-biotin exchange chemistry assay combined with proteomic mass spectrometry, we identified protein substrates palmitoylated by AkrA including two new putative P-type ATPases (Pmc1 and Spf1 homologs), a putative proton V-type proton ATPase (Vma5 homolog) and three putative proteins in A. nidulans, the transcripts of which have previously been shown to be induced by extracellular calcium stress in a CrzA-dependent manner. Thus, our findings provide strong evidence that the AkrA protein regulates [Ca 2+ ] c  homeostasis by palmitoylating these protein candidates and give new insights the role of palmitoylation in the regulation of calcium-mediated responses to extracellular, ER or plasma membrane stress.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nIn all eukaryotic cells, the cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2+ ] c ) concentration is strictly and precisely controlled by complex interactions between various calcium-channels, calcium-pumps and calcium-antiporters and by calcium buffering in the cytoplasm. Finely tuned changes in [Ca 2+ ] c  mediate a variety of intracellular functions, and disruption of [Ca 2+ ] c  homeostasis can lead to various pathological conditions [ XREF_BIBR ]. In fungi, numerous studies have shown that calcium signaling is involved in regulating a wide range of processes including cell morphogenesis, cell cycle progression, stress responses and virulence [ XREF_BIBR ]. Two different calcium uptake systems in the plasma membrane have been identified in most fungal species: the high-affinity Ca 2+  influx system (HACS) and the low-affinity calcium influx system (LACS) [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. The main components of the HACS are primarily composed of an alpha-subunit of the mammalian voltage-gated Ca 2+ -channel homolog Cch1 and a stretch-activated beta-subunit called Mid1. Loss of the HACS results in an inability to grow under low-calcium conditions. In addition, fungi possess a range of other calcium P-type ATPases and calcium transporters that play important roles in calcium signaling and homeostasis [ XREF_BIBR ]. Upon stimulation, calcium is rapidly taken up from the extracellular environment or released from these intracellular calcium stores and either interacts with the primary intracellular calcium sensor/receptor calmodulin or directly regulates that activity of other proteins. When the calcium signal binds to calmodulin this results in a conformational change in the protein allowing it to interact with and regulate the activity of various target proteins involved in converting the original stimuli into cellular responses. The [Ca 2+ ] c  increase is transient because various calcium-pumps and calcium-antiporters, as well as the cytoplasmic calcium buffering, subsequently return the [Ca 2+ ] c  to its normally low resting level within the cytosol [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\nThe phosphatase calcineurin is an important [Ca 2+ ] c  transient effector and is conserved from yeast to humans. Its most well known target in fungi is the transcription factor Crz1 (calcineurin responsive zinc finger 1) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In vegetatively growing S. cerevisiae cells, [Ca 2+ ] c  concentrations are normally maintained at low non-signaling levels. During this stage, Crz1 is fully phosphorylated, localized to the cytoplasm, and transcriptionally inactive [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. When fungal cells are exposed to chemicals that induce plasma membrane stress (e.g. by azole antifungals) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (e.g. by tunicamycin), or are under low calcium conditions, the HACS is activated. These stimuli result in calcium uptake and a transient increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  which leads to calcineurin activation and subsequent Crz1 de-phosphorylation. Crz1 is then recruited to nuclei where it transcriptionally regulates downstream signaling pathways to alleviate cellular stress and promote cell survival [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Interestingly, there are no known mammalian Crz1 orthologs, but mammals express another calcineurin sensitive transcription factor target, known as NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells). Crz1 does not belong to the NFAT family, but the Zn-finger domains in Crz1 and NFAT bind specific DNA sequences within the promoter regions of calcineurin-dependent response elements (CDREs) to activate transcription [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, there is a calcineurin-dependent Crz1 homolog, known as CrzA. Interestingly, calcineurin deletion causes more severe growth defects than CrzA deletion in this species, suggesting that calcineurin has additional target proteins other than CrzA [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\nPalmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational modification that catalyzes the attachment of palmitate to cytoplasmic cysteine residues of soluble and transmembrane proteins. Palmitoyl transferases (PATs) are known to be responsible for palmitoylation. The defining feature of PATs is the presence of a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) with an Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif, which is required for PAT activity. Many proteins that require palmitoylation are involved in cellular signaling, membrane trafficking and synaptic transmission [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. There are more than 20 encoded DHHC proteins in mammalian genomes, and there is now a major effort to verify DHHC-substrate partners and determine how their interaction specificity is encoded [ XREF_BIBR ]. Several lines of recent evidence have shown that protein palmitoylation influences various cell functions, physiology and pathophysiology [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ].\n\nIn this study, we have demonstrated that AnAkrA in A. nidulans and AfAkrA in A. fumigatus, which are homologs of the yeast palmitoyl transferase ScAkr1p, have similar function to the HACS in the presence of low extracellular calcium. The akrA deletion resulted in marked defects in hyphal extension and conidiation, especially under low calcium conditions. Moreover, using codon-optimized aequorin as a calcium reporter in living cells, we found that AkrA dysfunction significantly decreased the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] c  transient induced by an extracellular calcium stimulus, ER stress caused by tunicamycin or plasma membrane stress resulting from itraconazole, respectively. Our data suggest that these [Ca 2+ ] c  responses are mediated by the palmitoylation of the cysteine residue of the DHHC motif in AkrA. Moreover, we have identified that two new putative P-type ATPases (Pmc1 and Spf1 homologs), a putative proton V-type proton ATPase (Vma5 homolog) and three putative CrzA-dependent proteins, are palmitoylated substrates of the AkrA protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a palmitoylation protein is involved in regulating eukaryotic calcium signaling.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nPhenotypic characterization of the Golgi-localized AkrA.\n\nBased on a NCBI BLASTp search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), we identified a putative ortholog of NFAT in A. nidulans, AkrA (AN5824.4, Accession: XP_663428.1), which encodes a putative palmitoyltransferase. However, it showed low identity (less than 20%) or similarity (less than 30%) to mammalian NFAT based on full-length sequences. Interestingly, a bioinformatic analysis revealed that the promoter region contains a putative calcineurin-dependent-response-element (CDRE-like) motif. As shown in  XREF_FIG , we identified a CDRE-like sequence at 398 bp (akrA, AN5824.4), upstream of this gene's start codon [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. These data suggest that AkrA may be a component of the calcium signaling machinery. To further explore the function of the akrA gene and its relationship to calcineurin, the full-length deletion strain was constructed by homologous gene replacement employing a self-excising recyclable cassette that contains an AfpyrG gene as a selectable marker. Diagnostic PCR analysis of the resulting strain DeltaakrA confirmed the homologous replacement ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). We also generated DeltaakrADeltacnaA double mutants through genetic crosses (the cnaA gene encodes the catalytic subunit of calcineurin). The DeltaakrA mutant produced smaller colonies compared to that of the parental wild-type strain, when grown on minimal medium. In comparison, the DeltacnaA mutant exhibited severe growth defects on minimal medium. Moreover, the double mutant had a smaller colony size and underwent less conidiation than the single mutants ( XREF_FIG ). These results suggest that akrA and cnaA may have different functions in A. nidulans. Therefore, the double deletion mutant exacerbates the growth defects on minimal medium.\n\nWe next tested whether low external calcium conditions could affect the colony phenotype in the akrA deletion mutant. When conidia were spot inoculated onto the solid minimal medium containing the calcium chelator EGTA and were allowed to grow at 37degreesC for 2.5 days, the DeltaakrA mutant exhibited increased EGTA sensitivity compared to the parental wild-type strain. As shown in  XREF_FIG , the akrA deletion exhibited markedly reduced conidial formation and colony growth under low-calcium conditions. Since, mutants of the HACS components have been previously shown to exhibit similar defects under low calcium conditions [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], we next examined whether AkrA was a potential novel HACS component. To determine whether the defects in the DeltaakrA mutant could be rescued by high extracellular calcium, we inoculated DeltaakrA mutant conidia on minimal medium supplemented with 20 mM Ca 2+ . We found that the colony diameter of the DeltaakrA mutant was restored almost to the same diameter of the parental wild-type strain by the addition of extracellular calcium ( XREF_FIG ), indicating that exogenous calcium could completely rescue the colony growth defect caused by AkrA loss. We further examined conidiation in the DeltaakrA mutant in a calcium-limited environment (i.e. in the presence of EGTA) with a stereomicroscope ( XREF_FIG  left panels). The results showed that the vegetative mycelia from the parental wild-type strain were capable of producing numerous conidia under low-calcium conditions. In contrast, conidiation was almost completely abolished in the DeltaakrA mutant on minimal media supplemented with EGTA (1 mM) ( XREF_FIG  left panels). In submerged liquid culture, the wild-type strain displayed robust polarized hyphal growth around the margins of mycelial balls, whereas the DeltaakrA mutant showed smooth margins around small mycelial balls ( XREF_FIG  right panels). Consistently, the DeltaakrA mutant had a significantly reduced biomass, germination rate, and colony size compared to the parental strain on minimal media ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Moreover, ectopically expressed akrA was able to completely rescue these defects in the akrA deletion strain ( XREF_FIG ), establishing that these phenotypes were specific to the loss of akrA. In addition, we deleted the akrA homolog gene in A. fumigatus. Similar to the DeltaakrA phenotypes in A. nidulans, the DeltaAfakrA mutant displayed hypersensitivity to the low calcium conditions, and its phenotypic defects could be rescued by high extracellular calcium ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Thus, these data are consistent with AkrA being involved in calcium uptake especially in a calcium-limited environment.\n\nTo further confirm and assess the localization and the molecular mass of AkrA, we generated a conditional expression allele, alcA(p)::GFP-akrA, referred to here as ZYA09 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In this conditional allele, akrA expression was assumed to be regulated by the carbon source, as it was not induced by glucose, induced by glycerol, and overexpressed to high levels by L-threonine [ XREF_BIBR ]. To determine whether this conditional allele behaved as predicted, we inoculated the ZYA09 strain in liquid media for 18 h, which promoted induction, non-induction or overexpression. As expected, the akrA mRNA level was approximately 20-fold higher when grown in overexpressing medium compared to that grown in non-inducing medium, which was 12-fold higher than that in inducing medium ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Moreover, the conditional strain ZYA09 displayed an identical phenotype to the parental wild-type strain when grown on the inducing or the overexpressing media, indicating that the fusion GFP-AkrA protein was functional and that the assumed akrA over-expression had no detectable effects in A. nidulans. In comparison, when grown on the non-inducing medium, the conditional allele alcA(p)::GFP-akrA exhibited an identical phenotype to the DeltaakrA mutant, confirming a consistent phenotype for the loss of AkrA and for the knock-down of AkrA (Figs  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ). Western blotting showed a band at approximately 110 kDa in the GFP-AkrA strain grown under inducing or overexpressing conditions using an anti-GFP antibody but no such a band appeared in the parental wild-type strain or the conditional allele (ZYA09) under the non-inducing condition ( XREF_FIG ). These results indicate that the molecular mass of AkrA is approximately 80 kDa because GFP is a 27 kDa protein.\n\nMicroscopic examination showed that the AkrA-GFP localization pattern resembled that of the Golgi previously reported in A. nidulans [ XREF_BIBR ]. To confirm this we generated the strain ZYA13 by genetically crossing the alcA(p)::GFP-akrA strain ZYA09 with the MAD2013 strain in which the late Golgi marker (gpdA mini ::mRFP-PH OSBP ), consisting of the pleckstrin homology domain of the human oxysterol binding protein (PH OSBP ) fused to mRFP was included [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Spores of the ZYA13 strain were incubated in non-inducing medium at 37degreesC for 10 h and were then shifted to the overexpression medium for 6 h. Microscopic examination of the young germlings produced under these conditions showed the majority of GFP-AkrA proteins colocalized with mRFP-PH OSBP  late Golgi marker ( XREF_FIG ).\n\n\n\nThe DHHC motif is required for AkrA function.\n\nBecause the bioinformatic analysis showed that AkrA contains a conserved DHHC motif required for its palmitoylation activity [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], we next investigated whether the DHHC motif was required for the normal function of AkrA under low calcium conditions. We first constructed a C-terminal AkrA truncation lacking the region from the DHHC motif through to the stop codon by homologous gene replacement ( XREF_FIG ). The colony phenotype of the truncation mutant was similar to that resulting from the complete deletion of the akrA gene when grown in minimal medium plus EGTA, indicating that the DHHC motif is required for AkrA function ( XREF_FIG ). To rule out the possibility that a loss of function in the truncated mutant might result from a conformational change that prevented a true reflection of the function of the DHHC motif, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. Since Cys 487  in the DHHC motif has previously been shown to be crucial for palmitoyl transferase activity, we therefore mutated Cys 487  to Ser 487  in the DHHC motif ( XREF_FIG ) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Consequently, we found that the C487S site-mutated DHHS fragment could not rescue the defect of the akrA deletion mutant under either the control of a native promoter (native(p)::akrA C487S ) or a GPD promoter (GPD(p)::akrA C487S ) ( XREF_FIG ). In comparison, the wild-type akrA gene completely rescued the growth defects in the akrA deletion recipient strain. To confirm that these fusion cassettes were transcribed in the transformant, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to verify the akrA mRNA levels. The results showed that both the GPD and native promoters induced normal akrA mRNA expression, even though the mRNA expression level under the control of the GPD promoter was higher than that with the native promoter ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), indicating that the AkrA-DHHS cassettes were fully transcribed. Next, we generated Flag-tagged AkrA and the site mutated AkrA C487S  strains to further confirm the expression of the AkrA protein. As shown in  XREF_FIG , the predicted bands on a Western blot were observed clearly, suggesting that both Flag-AkrA and Flag-AkrA C487S  proteins were fully expressed in vivo. In addition, the Flag-tagged AkrA C487S  strain displayed an identical phenotype to that of the Flag-untagged (native(p)::akrA C487S ) mutant, suggesting that the Flag tag could not phenotypically change the function of the targeted protein AkrA ( XREF_FIG ). These data suggest that the growth defect caused by akrA deletion was closely associated with the Cys 487  site in the DHHC motif.\n\n\n\nAkrA functions independently of previously identified HACS components.\n\nBecause the loss of akrA caused a similar defect phenotype to that of deletion mutants of the HACS components cchA and midA under the low calcium conditions, we hypothesized that AkrA forms a complex with CchA or MidA to perform its function. To assess whether AkrA physically interacts with CchA or MidA, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays. We cloned the cDNA fragments corresponding to the cytosolic C-terminus of cchA and the full-length cDNA of midA, respectively. They were then amplified and cloned into the pGADT7 vector, which contains the GAL4 DNA-AD and the LEU2 marker. In addition, a full-length cDNA of akrA was cloned into the pGBKT7 vector, which contains the GAL4 DNA-BD and TRP1 marker. As a result, some small colonies of pGBKT7-akrA with pGADT7-cchA were obtained, and there was no detectable growth of colonies of pGBKT7-akrA with pGADT7-midA under the high stringency screening conditions compared to the positive colonies of pGADT7-T and pGBKT7-53, which showed robust growth ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These data suggest that AkrA and MidA do not directly interact, and that AkrA and CchA might weakly and transiently interacted.\n\nWe next investigated the functional interaction(s) between AkrA and CchA and between AkrA and MidA by a genetic phenotypic analysis. The DeltaakrADeltamidA, DeltaakrADeltacchA double mutants were generated by genetic crossing. As shown in Figs  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY , phenotypic defects in colony size and conidiation were exacerbated in the double mutants compared to the parental single mutants, especially in the presence of EGTA. Notably, the growth retardation of the DeltaakrADeltamidA and DeltaakrADeltacchA double mutants under low calcium conditions was reversed by the addition of 20 mM calcium to the minimal medium. These results suggest that AkrA, CchA, and MidA are all required under the calcium-limited condition, but may have some non-overlapping roles in growth. To determine whether overexpression of cchA could rescue the DeltaakrA defects under the low calcium condition, we crossed DeltaakrA (ZYA02) and alcA(p)::GFP-cchA (ZYA11) to generate the ZYA12 strain. Real-time PCR verified that the mRNA level of cchA in ZYA12 was approximately 15-fold higher in the overexpressing medium than in the inducing medium when cultured for 18 h ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). However, overexpression of cchA did not rescue the DeltaakrA defects under low calcium conditions ( XREF_FIG ).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that pmr1, which encodes a Ca 2+ /Mn 2+  P-type ATPase and is involved in Ca 2+  homeostasis, localizes to the Golgi in yeast [ XREF_BIBR ]. In A. nidulans, DeltapmrA had no discernible effect on fungal physiology, but the cells were hypersensitive to low extracellular calcium [ XREF_BIBR ]. To investigate the link between AkrA and PmrA, we crossed the DeltaakrA and DeltapmrA mutants. Surprisingly, the double mutant had no detectable defect when grown in minimal medium compared to the DeltaakrA strain, which had a reduced-colony size ( XREF_FIG ). These data suggest that the pmrA deletion suppressed the DeltaakrA growth defect. However, when cultured on minimal medium with 1 mM EGTA, the double mutant showed an exacerbated growth retardation phenotype compared to the parental single mutants. In addition, the phenotypic defects of DeltaakrADeltapmrA were completely suppressed by the addition of 20 mM calcium. These results suggest that AkrA and PmrA may operate together in regulating cellular calcium homeostasis in a reverse way.\n\n\n\nAkrA mediates the extracellular calcium-induced [Ca 2+ ] c  transient.\n\nPrevious studies with yeast reported that Cch1 and Mid1 mutations reduced calcium uptake and affected [Ca 2+ ] c  accumulation under both stimulating and non-stimulating conditions [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. We monitored the extracellular calcium-induced [Ca 2+ ] c  changes in living cells of A. nidulans wild type and mutant strains in which we expressed codon-optimized aequorin [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. When treated with 0.1 M CaCl 2 , the [Ca 2+ ] c  concentration in wild type cells transiently increased from a resting level of approximately 0.1 muM to a peak concentration of 1.2 muM ( XREF_FIG ). In comparison, cchA or midA mutants showed a reduction of 17 +/- 11% or 25 +/- 12% in the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitudes, respectively, under the same stimulating conditions. Surprisingly, the decrease in the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude in akrA mutants was much larger than that observed in the HACS mutants. The [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitudes were decreased as follows: 53 +/- 13% in the akrA deletion strain ZYA02, 54 +/- 9% in the DHHC truncated mutant ZYA15, and 55 +/- 8% in the site-mutated native(p)::akrA C487S  mutant ZYA16. These data suggest the significant reduction in calcium influx due to the loss of AkrA is mediated by the DHHC motif and, in particular, the cysteine residue within the DHHC motif.\n\nThe [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude in the DeltapmrA mutant exposed to the 0.1 M CaCl 2  stimulus was similar to that of the parental wild-type strain, which is different from that previously reported for yeast [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ], suggesting that other Ca 2+ -ATPases may compensate for the loss of PmrA function in response to the extracellular calcium stimulus. However, loss of pmrA in the akrA deletion background was able to recover the decreased [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude in the akrA mutant to a similar level as that in the parental wild-type strain in response this extracellular calcium stimulus, indicating that the perturbation of calcium homeostasis induced by AkrA could be rescued by loss of pmrA.\n\nThe protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) is a palmitate analog that blocks palmitate incorporation into proteins [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. To determine whether inhibition of palmitoyl transferase activity influences calcium influx into the cytoplasm, we measured the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude of the wild type pre-incubated in 2-BP (20 muM) for 2 h. Following this drug treatment, the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] c  increase following stimulation with 0.1 M CaCl 2  was significantly reduced by approximately 40% of the untreated cells in response to stimulation with 0.1 M CaCl 2  ( XREF_FIG ). These data suggest that the inhibition of palmitoyl transferase activity can significantly block calcium influx.\n\n\n\nLoss of AkrA abolishes [Ca 2+ ] c  responses to ER or plasma membrane stress.\n\nActivation of Ca 2+  channels, calmodulin, calcineurin and other factors is necessary for the long-term survival of cells undergoing ER stress, and during this process the HACS components, CchA and MidA, are required for Ca 2+  influx from the extracellular environment [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. To verify whether AkrA is involved in the calcium influx response during ER stress, we measured the influence of the ER-stress agents, tunicamycin (TM) and dithiothreitol (DTT) on [Ca 2+ ] c . When the parental wild-type strain was treated with 5 mug/mL tunicamycin, we observed an immediate transient increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  with an amplitude of 0.60 +/- 0.03 muM ( XREF_FIG ). In comparison, the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude in the DeltacchA mutant (but not the DeltamidA mutant) in response to tunicamycin was decreased by approximately 32 +/- 6%, suggesting that the loss of CchA but not MidA mediates the ER stress-induced calcium influx in A. nidulans. Furthermore, in response to tunicamycin treatment the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude decreased by 40 +/- 5%, 34 +/- 8% and 34 +/- 6% in the DeltaakrA, akrADeltaC, native(p)::akrA C487S  mutants, respectively. We next examined the [Ca 2+ ] c  response after addition of DTT, another agent causing ER-stress. 10 mM DTT induced a rapid increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  which peaked at approximately 0.40 muM in the wild-type and DeltamidA strains, but the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitudes decreased by approximately 40% in the DeltaakrA (36 +/- 10%), akrADeltaC (37 +/- 7%), and native(p)::akrA C487S  (36 +/- 8%) mutants, and by 15 +/- 9% in the DeltacchA mutant ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These data suggest that CchA, but not MidA, influences the ER stress-induced calcium influx in A. nidulans, which is different from that previously reported in yeast [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Furthermore, loss of AkrA, or mutations in its DHHC significantly decreased the ER stress-induced calcium influx. We further tested whether the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] c  increase in response to tunicamycin was dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration. We found that there was no significant change when mycelia were cultured in media with or without 5 mM calcium ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In contrast, exposure of cells to 1 mM EGTA prior to tunicamycin treatment completely abolished the increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  in the DeltaakrA, akrADeltaC and native(p)::akrA C487S  mutants, but not in the parental wild-type, DeltacchA or DeltamidA strains ( XREF_FIG ). Similar data was obtained when we used the more selective, calcium chelator BAPTA ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These data suggest that intracellular calcium stores contribute to the transient increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  induced by agents causing ER stress.\n\nBecause azole antifungal drugs induce plasma membrane stress [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ], we next compared the differences in the [Ca 2+ ] c  transient between wild-type and relevant mutant strains after treatment with the azole antifungal agent itraconazole (ITZ), which is currently used as a primary antifungal drug in the clinic. In all the tested mutants and the wild-type strain, the [Ca 2+ ] c  resting levels were similar at approximately 0.05 muM. After addition of 1 mug/mL ITZ to the medium, all strains responded with a transient increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  ( XREF_FIG ). However, all the akrA defective mutants exhibited significantly lower increases in [Ca 2+ ] c  compared to their parental wild-type strain: the amplitudes of the [Ca 2+ ] c  transients were reduced by 36 +/- 11% in the DeltaakrA, 29 +/- 10% in the akrADeltaC, 24 +/- 8% in the native(p)::akrA C487S  and 27 +/- 8% in the DeltacchA mutants, respectively, compared to that of the parental wild-type strain. In marked contrast to these mutants, the DeltamidA mutant exhibited a similar [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude in response to ITZ as observed in the wild-type strain. In addition, the amplitude of the ITZ-induced [Ca 2+ ] c  elevation increased when mycelia were cultured in media containing 5 mM CaCl 2  ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). We next examined whether the [Ca 2+ ] c  transient induced in response to ITZ was dependent on external calcium or internal calcium stores. We exposed hyphal cells to media supplemented with EGTA (1 mM) prior to ITZ treatment, and found that [Ca 2+ ] c  transients were dramatically abolished in all the DeltaakrA mutants, whereas the [Ca 2+ ] c  transients in the wild type, and the DeltacchA and DeltamidA mutants, were still observed ( XREF_FIG ). Similar data were obtained when we used the calcium chelator BAPTA ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These data indicate that the loss of AkrA or disruption of its DHHC motif in the absence of extracellular calcium completely block calcium influx after treatment with chemicals that induce ER or plasma membrane stress from both extracellular and intracellular sources. Furthermore, both extracellular calcium and intracellular calcium stores play roles in generating these [Ca 2+ ] c  transients induced by these stress treatments.\n\n\n\nThe cysteine residue of the DHHC motif is required for AkrA palmitoylation.\n\nOur evidence above indicates that the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif of AkrA is involved in regulating the calcium response to high extracellular calcium-, ER- and plasma membrane-stress. To test whether the cysteine residue of DHHC is required for AkrA palmitoylation, we set up an acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) chemistry assay to detect palmitoylation in potential target proteins based on selective thioester hydrolysis by hydroxylamine (HA) ( XREF_FIG ). Compared to the control, the treatment of hydroxylamine combined with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (which blocks free sulhydryls), efficiently enriches palmitoylated proteins. Subsequent treatment with HA cleaves the thioester bond between palmitate and cysteine residues, exposing bound thiols, which are then covalently linked to HPDP-biotin. The controls were protein samples not treated with HA. Lastly, the biotinylated proteins were bound to streptavidin agarose, washed with buffer, and eluted by cleavage of the cysteine-biotin disulfide linkage following by SDS-PAGE. Several previous reports have suggested that the process of palmitoylation involves in a two-step mechanism in which palmitoyl transferase is auto-acylated by itself to create an intermediate followed by the transfer of the palmitoyl moiety to its substrate [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Therefore, to investigate whether the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif is responsible for AkrA auto-acylation, we used the ABE assay to detect whether AkrA palmitoylates itself [ XREF_BIBR ]. As shown in  XREF_FIG , when HA was present, Flag-AkrA can be clearly detected with an anti-Flag antibody. However, a site-directed mutation of the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif and the parental wild-type strain pre-cultured with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) completely abolished palmitoylation of AkrA, which resulted in no signal being detected in the enriched pamitoylated proteins. These results indicate that AkrA is able to be auto-acylated and the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif is required for this process. In addition, we found that treatment with 2-BP (24 h, 50 and 100 muM) virtually abolished the Golgi localization of GFP-labelled AkrA ( XREF_FIG ) and resulted in a similar defective growth defect phenotype to the DeltaakrA mutant on minimal medium ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ).\n\nWe constructed another alcA(p)::GFP-akrA C487S  mutant and confirmed by Western blotting ( XREF_FIG ) to further check whether site directed mutagenesis of the Cys 487  in the DHHC motif disrupted the normal localization of AkrA in the Golgi. The GFP-AkrA C487S  was less distinctly localized in the punctate Golgi structures characteristic of wild-type GFP-AkrA and some appeared to be localized in the cytoplasm ( XREF_FIG ). These data collectively suggest that the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif of AkrA and the palmitoylation activity are closely associated with AkrA auto-acylation, which is required for normal AkrA localization and palmitoylation.\n\nTo further explore palmitoylated protein substrates specifically mediated by AkrA, total proteins of the wild-type and DeltaakrA strains were treated and analyzed using the ABE chemistry assay combined with liquid chromatograpy-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for comparative proteomics ( XREF_FIG ). Using this approach, 334 proteins were identified as potential AkrA substrates in the parental wild-type strain because they were completely absent in the DeltaakrA strain. As shown in  XREF_TABLE , AkrA belonged to one of the AkrA-mediated pamitoylated substrates suggesting it is able to auto-acylate itself. Among the palmitoylated protein candidates identified, Yck2, Lcb1, Ras2, Cdc48 and Pab1 have been previously identified as palmitoylated proteins in S. cerevisiae but only Yck2 has been characterized as an Akr1 substrate [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. These data indicated that the ABE chemistry assay combined with LC-MS was a valid approach to identify proteins palmitoylated by AkrA and it also indicated that A. nidulans may palmitoylate some of the substrates previously reported in S. cerevisiae. In our study we notably identified the following protein substrates palmitoylated by AkrA: a vacuolar Ca 2+ -ATPase Pmc1 homolog (AN5088.4); a P-type ATPase Spf1 homolog (AN3146.4) involved in calcium homeostasis [ XREF_BIBR ]; a putative V-type H + -ATPase Vma5 homolog (AN1195.4) that has been linked to Ca 2+ -ATPase function [ XREF_BIBR ], and three uncharacterized proteins (AN8774.4, AN3420.4 and AN2427.4), the transcripts of which have previously been shown to be induced by extracellular calcium stress in a CrzA-dependent manner [ XREF_BIBR ]. These results provide strong evidence that the AkrA protein regulates [Ca 2+ ] c  homeostasis in A. nidulans by palmitoylating these protein candidates. Other candidate substrates of AkrA that we identified included the P450 enzymes, Cyp51A (Erg11A), Cyp51B (Erg11B) and Erg5 homologs, which are all involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and azole resistance. Thus AkrA may influence the azole resistance by these biosynthetic enzymes.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nPalmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification that is involved in regulating the trafficking and the functional modulation of membrane proteins. Many proteins that rely on palmitoylation are key players in cellular signaling, membrane trafficking and synaptic transmission [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Yeast Akr1p was the first characterized palmitoyl transferase (PAT) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. AkrA, a human AkrA homolog HIP14, is involved in palmitoylation and plays an important role in the trafficking of multiple neuronal proteins associated with Huntington's disease [ XREF_BIBR ]. Calcium serves a multitude of signaling and structural functions in all eukaryotes. Recent studies in mammalian systems have shown that the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor/Ca 2+ -release channel RyR1 is subject to S-palmitoylation modification in ''hot spot'' regions containing sites of mutations implicated in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, studies on the relationship between calcium signaling components and palmitoylation are very scarce. In this study, we identified that homologs of the yeast palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans (AkrA) and A. fumigatus (AfAkrA) are required for hyphal growth and sporulation under low external calcium conditions. High extracellular calcium-, ER- and plasma membrane-stress conditions all elicited transient increases in [Ca 2+ ] c . These [Ca 2+ ] c  responses were all mediated by AkrA and involved the cysteine residue in its DHHC motif, which was shown to be required for AkrA palmitoylation. Candidate protein substrates that the AkrA protein is involved in palmitoylating were found to include many key components involved in membrane trafficking and cellular signaling processes including known palmitoylated Ras-like proteins ( XREF_TABLE ). Among them were: a vacuolar Ca 2+  ATPase Pmc1 homolog [ XREF_BIBR ]; a putative P-type ATPase Spf1 homolog, which is involved in ER function and calcium homeostasis in budding yeast and Candida albicans [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]; a Vma5 homolog that has been linked with Pmr1 Ca 2+ -ATPase function [ XREF_BIBR ], and three calcium signaling- related proteins (encoded by AN8774.4, AN3420.4 and AN2724.4), the transcripts of which have been previously shown to be induced in response to high extracellular calcium stress which is dependent on the transcription factor CrzA [ XREF_BIBR ]. Key P450 enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway were also identified as AkrA palmitoylated proteins. Thus, our findings suggest that mutation of the DHHC motif in AkrA results in the disruption of [Ca 2+ ] c  homeostasis that is mainly due to the absence of the post-translational, palmitoylated-modification of key proteins involved in calcium signaling/homeostasis. PmcA and SpfA are homologs of two Ca 2+  ATPases which response for sequestrating calcium into intercellular compartments in S. cerevisiae [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ].\n\n\n\nAkrA mediates the [Ca 2+ ] c  transient in response to high extracellular calcium stress independently of the CchA/MidA complex.\n\nDeletion of the akrA gene exhibited marked growth and conidiation defects under low calcium conditions, which is similar to the defects caused by mutations in the CchA/MidA HACS [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, the akrA deletion conferred increased sensitivity to Li + , Na + , K + , Mg 2+ , but slightly increased resistance to the cell wall disrupting agents compared to the parental wild-type strain ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Moreover, the DeltaakrADeltacchA and DeltaakrADeltamidA double mutants exacerbated the DeltaakrA defects under calcium-limited conditions, suggesting that AkrA may have independent functions to those of the CchA-MidA complex. AkrA localized to trans Golgi structures ( XREF_FIG ), while the CchA-MidA complex probably localizes to the plasma membrane as reported for yeast [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. In addition, results from the Y2H assays ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) suggested that there were no direct, or only very weak, interactions between AkrA and CchA and between AkrA and MidA. Nevertheless, the [Ca 2+ ] c  transient in the DeltaakrA mutant had a much lower amplitude (approximately 53 +/- 13% lower) than the wild-type control following treatment with a high extracellular calcium stress stimulus, suggesting that the loss of AkrA reduced calcium influx into the cytoplasm. In contrast, loss of CchA and MidA caused a 25% decrease in the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude in response to this treatment with high external calcium, consistent with the results from previous studies on yeast cells lacking either Cch1 or Mid1, which exhibited a low calcium uptake [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. The akrA deletion also had a bigger impact on inhibiting calcium influx in response to ER stress than observed in the DeltacchA and DeltamidA mutants. Overall our data suggests that AkrA regulates calcium uptake from the external medium as well and its release from intracellular Ca 2+  stores through a pathway that is independent of the previously identified CchA/MidA HACS as shown in  XREF_FIG . PmrA is an A. nidulans homolog of yeast Pmr1, which is a P-type Golgi Ca 2+ /Mn 2+  ATPase responsible for Ca 2+  transport into the Golgi and widely accepted as responsible for Ca 2+  efflux from the cytoplasm into the Golgi to regulate calcium signaling and homeostasis and prevent calcium toxicity. Loss of Pmr1 function in budding yeast is believed to inhibit the return of [Ca 2+ ] c  to its resting level following stimulus-induced [Ca 2+ ] c  increases [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. In contrast, our data showed that the pmrA deletion in A. nidulans exhibited no significant change in the calcium signature following a high extracellular calcium stress stimulus compared with the wild-type strain, suggesting that other paralogs of pmrA (e.g. other Ca 2+ -ATPases) may compensate or play more important roles in returning the elevated [Ca 2+ ] c  back to its resting level. Surprisingly, loss of pmrA alleviated the decreased response of the DeltaakrA mutants to the external calcium stimulus, resulting in the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] c  increase of the double mutant DeltapmrADeltaakrA being almost back to the normal level of the wild type. Thus deletion of PmrA reverses the effects of the AkrA deletion in regulating calcium influx following extracellular calcium stress. The lower amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] c  increase of the DeltaakrA mutant in response to the high extracellular calcium stimulus indicate that AkrA and its pamitoylated targets play a role in mediating the calcium influx into the cytoplasm and then PmrA may store cytoplasmic calcium into Golgi. When both PmrA and AkrA were absent, the increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  following extracellular calcium stimulation was back to almost the normal level in the wild-type ( XREF_FIG ). This suggests that the [Ca 2+ ] c  increase in the DeltapmrADeltaakrA double mutant following treatment with high extracellular calcium is compensated by some other unknown component(s) of the calcium signaling/homeostatic machinery. Furthermore, our data ( XREF_FIG ) showed that loss of pmrA suppressed the colony growth defect of DeltaakrA mutants, providing further evidence to support interactive regulatory roles of PmrA and AkrA in A.nidulans.\n\nPrevious studies have verified that exposure of fungi to ER or plasma membrane stress stimulates store-operated calcium influx through the HACS to promote fungal cell survival [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Consistent with previous studies, in A. nidulans we observed a transient increase in [Ca 2+ ] c  after treatment with the ER-stress agents tunicamycin (TM) or dithiothreitol (DTT). The DeltacchA mutant exhibited reduced [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitudes by 32 +/- 6% and 15 +/- 9% upon treatment with TM or DTT, respectively (Figs  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). In contrast, we did not detect a change in the [Ca 2+ ] c  response to the ER stress agents in the DeltamidA mutant compared to its parental wild-type strain. This suggests that as a complex of CchA and MidA, CchA may have a more predominant role than MidA during the ER stress response. Moreover, the DeltaakrA mutant displayed a decreased response to ER and plasma membrane stress inducing drugs, as the [Ca 2+ ] c  amplitude of DeltaakrA mutants decreased by approximately 36-40% of the wild-type strain following treatment with these drugs (Figs  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These data suggest that, in addition to HACS components, AkrA is also involved in ER and plasma membrane stress-induced calcium influx. Moreover, these responses were completely abolished in the DeltaakrA mutant but not in the wild-type strain in the presence of EGTA or BAPTA that chelate external calcium. These results indicate that both extracellular calcium and calcium stores contribute to the transient [Ca 2+ ] c  changes following ER or plasma membrane stress. Because calcium release from intracellular stores in response to these types of stress was abolished in the akrA mutants (Figs  XREF_FIG ,  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ), our results are consistent with AkrA regulating calcium influx across the plasma membrane, which in turn activates the release of calcium from intracellular pools.\n\nAltogether, our results provide the first report that AkrA is a putative palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans, and it mediates calcium influx in a DHHC-dependent mechanism to perform an essential function in calcium homeostasis/signaling for survival under high extracellular calcium-, ER- or azole antifungal-stress conditions.\n\nCalcium signaling regulators have been previously identified as antifungal target candidates, including FK506, which targets calcineurin [ XREF_BIBR ]. However, most of the fungal homologs of known calcium signaling components in mammalian cells are of proteins also required for mammalian cell growth and metabolism [ XREF_BIBR ]. Thus, potential antifungals against these components may cause side effects in mammalian hosts. The use of drugs that target regulators of posttranslational modification of calcium signaling that show significant differences to their mammalian homologs (e.g. AkrA only exhibits 24.8% identity to the human AkrA homolog HIP14), may circumvent this problem. The potential for developing novel antifungal drugs of this type has been greatly facilitated by our study that has shown a critical link between palmitoylation and calcium signaling.\n\n\n\nThe [Ca 2+ ] c  response is closely associated with the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif which is correspondingly required for AkrA palmitoylation.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that all AkrA homologs across different species require the DHHC motif to be active and function normally as palmitoyl transferases [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ]. Three approaches were initially employed to determine AkrA function: deletion of the DHHC motif; site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif; and use of a specific palmitoyl transferase analogue inhibitor (2-bromopalmitate), to determine AkrA function [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Our data from these experiments suggested that the DHHC motif and its cysteine residue are required for the function of AkrA, especially when extracellular calcium is limited. To further test whether the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif, is correspondingly required for AkrA palmitoylation, we used the acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) chemistry assay to detect palmitoylation based on selective thioester hydrolysis by hydroxylamine. Compared to the treatment without hydroxylamine, the newly exposed cysteine residues are disulfide-bonded to a biotin analogue, affinity purified and digested into peptides, leaving the labeled peptides on the affinity beads so that palmitoylated proteins have been enriched. As the ABE chemistry detects palmitoylation through identification of all the thioester linkages. A subsequent Western experiment was used to further confirm palmitoylated proteins by specific antibodies. Consequently, among these enriched palmitoylated proteins, Flag-AkrA was clearly detected with an anti-Flag antibody. Site-directed mutation of the cysteine residue in the DHHC or treatment of the parental wild-type strain with the palmitoyl transferase analogue inhibitor 2-BP completely abolished palmitoylation of AkrA ( XREF_FIG ). Previous studies have demonstrated that although the exact mechanism of S-acylation is not known, palmitoylation of the purified DHHC-CRD palmitoylated proteins zDHHC2, zDHHC3 and yeast Erf2, involves a two-step mechanism, in which the zDHHCs form an acyl-enzyme intermediate (auto-acylation), with the acyl group later transferred to the target protein [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ]. Our results indicated that AkrA auto-acylated itself before palmitoylating its target proteins. In mammalian cells, any protein that contains a surface-exposed and freely accessible cysteine that has transient access to Golgi membranes is susceptible to palmitoylation. Our data suggests AkrA both auto-acylated itself and palmitoylates target proteins in association with Golgi membranes. Moreover, we found that site directed mutagenesis of the Cys 487  in the DHHC motif significantly affect normal localization of AkrA in the Golgi. When we treated cells with a specific palmitoyl transferase analogue inhibitor 2-BP, AkrA localization within the Golgi localization was completely lost ( XREF_FIG ), suggesting that the 2-BP treatment not only prevented AkrA auto-acyltation but also prevented the normal subcellular localization of AkrA. The reason for the different localization pattern, if any, caused by the site directed mutagenesis and the treatment of 2-BP as shown in  XREF_FIG  is likely to be due to a side effect of the 2-BP reagent.\n\nIn conclusion, our results provide the first report that AkrA is a palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans, and that it mediates calcium influx in a DHHC-dependent mechanism to perform an essential role in calcium homeostasis to survive high extracellular calcium-, ER- and plasma membrane-stress conditions. A working model of AkrA function in regulating [Ca 2+ ] c  homeostasis in A. nidulans is presented in  XREF_FIG . Our findings provide new insights into the link between palmitoylation and calcium signaling that may be of relevance for understanding the mechanistic basis of human PAT-related diseases. Regulators of posttranslational modification in fungi may provide promising targets for new therapies against life threatening fungal diseases.\n\n",
