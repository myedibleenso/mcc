      "text":"Ca 2+  Signaling Modulates Cytolytic T Lymphocyte Effector Functions .\n\n\n\nCytolytic T cells use two mechanisms to kill virally infected cells, tumor cells, or other potentially autoreactive T cells in short-term in vitro assays. The perforin/granule exocytosis mechanism uses preformed cytolytic granules that are delivered to the target cell to induce apoptosis  and eventual lysis. FasL/Fas (CD95 ligand/CD95)-mediated cytolysis requires de novo protein  synthesis of FasL by the CTL and the presence of the death receptor Fas on the target cell to induce apoptosis. Using a CD8 +  CTL clone that kills via both the perforin/granule exocytosis  and FasL/Fas mechanisms, and a clone that kills via the FasL/Fas mechanism only, we have examined the requirement of intra- and extracellular Ca 2+  in TCR-triggered cytolytic effector  function. These two clones, a panel of Ca 2+  antagonists, and agonists were used to determine  that a large biphasic increase in intracellular calcium concentration, characterized by release of  Ca 2+  from intracellular stores followed by a sustained influx of extracellular Ca 2+ , is required  for perforin/granule exocytosis. Only the sustained influx of extracellular Ca 2+  is required for  FasL induction and killing. Thapsigargin, at low concentrations, induces this small but sustained  increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  and selectively induces FasL/Fas-mediated cytolysis but not granule exocytosis. These results further define the role of Ca 2+  in perforin and FasL/Fas killing and demonstrate that differential Ca 2+  signaling can modulate T cell effector functions.\n\n\n\nUpon recognition of Ag/MHC, a cytolytic T cell  (CTL) is activated to perform many effector functions, including cytokine secretion, receptor modulation,  cytolysis and eventually cell division and proliferation, or  apoptosis and death. CTLs use at least three mechanisms of  killing to lyse virus-infected cells, tumor cells, or potentially autoreactive T cells. The perforin and Fas ligand  (FasL)/Fas 1  mechanisms account for all of the killing detected in short term assays in vitro ( XREF_BIBR ) with the TNF-alpha  mechanism requiring 24-48 h ( XREF_BIBR ). The perforin/granule  exocytosis pathway is primarily used to kill virus infected  and tumorigenic cells ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ) and is characterized by the  pore-forming protein, perforin, and several proteases or  granzymes that are stored in the CTL's cytolytic granules  ( XREF_BIBR ). Upon Ag/MHC recognition, these proteins are delivered to the target cell to induce membrane damage, apoptosis, and eventually lysis ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). This lethal hit is delivered with a t 1/2  of 7-10 min and is both temperature and  Ca 2+  dependent ( XREF_BIBR ). The FasL/Fas mechanism of killing  appears not to be involved in eradication of virally infected  cells, but instead plays an important role in eliminating autoreactive T cells ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). This is evident in mice or  humans that lack FasL or Fas and which develop lymphadenopathy and lupus-like autoimmunity ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Both the perforin and the FasL/Fas mechanism require TCR-Ag/MHC  interactions, which trigger perforin/granule exocytosis and  induce FasL expression respectively. Because FasL expression requires de novo protein synthesis in the T cell, it takes  longer to lyse the target cell than the perforin/granule exocytosis mechanism ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Once FasL is expressed on the  surface of the T cell it can kill Fas-expressing cells in an  MHC-unrestricted manner ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Since perforin-mediated  cytolysis involves release of preformed granules whereas FasL/ Fas cytolysis requires induction of gene expression, we asked  whether these effector functions are regulated by different  TCR signaling pathways.\n\nThe TCR signal transduction pathways that regulate  perforin and FasL/Fas killing are less well defined than the  multiple pathways identified that regulate IL-2 production  in CD4 +  Th1 cells. The PI3kinase, protein kinase C, Ras/ Raf/Erk, JNK, and Ca 2+  signaling pathways have all been  implicated in regulating IL-2 production in CD4 +  T cells  ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). Calcium signaling regulates growth, death, differentiation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion in T cells  ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). Several Ca 2+ -sensitive transcriptional regulators,  including NF-kappaB ( XREF_BIBR ), Jun kinase (JNK) ( XREF_BIBR ), and NFAT  (nuclear factor of activated T cells; reference  XREF_BIBR ) participate  in varying combinations to regulate growth cytokines such  as IL-2, IL-4, and GM-CSF and inflammatory cytokines such  as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). More recently, several groups have reported that tyrosine kinases such as  ZAP70 and PI3K are involved in regulating FasL expression ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). A sustained rise in intracellular Ca 2+  concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) can activate calcineurin, a Ca 2+ -dependent,  cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive serine/threonine phosphatase  that dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFAT ( XREF_BIBR ).  Once dephosphorylated, NFAT migrates to the nucleus,  where it associates with Jun and Fos to promote transcription of a host of immunoregulatory genes ( XREF_BIBR ). Calcium  regulation of NFAT translocation in and out of the nucleus  and transcription of an IL-2 reporter gene has been visualized at the single cell level ( XREF_BIBR ). The importance of Ca 2+  in  lymphocyte activation is evident from the effectiveness of  the immunosuppressant CsA (BIOMOL Research Labs.,  Plymouth Meeting, PA) and the finding that patients with  lymphocytes defective in Ca 2+  signaling suffer from primary immunodeficiency ( XREF_BIBR ).\n\nClassical studies performed by Gray and co-workers recorded the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca 2+  signaling in  CTLs after TCR engagement ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). This TCR triggering led to a two component increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  due from an  initial release of Ca 2+  from intracellular stores followed by a  sustained influx of extracellular Ca 2+  ( XREF_BIBR ). Additional studies demonstrated that extracellular Ca 2+  was required for  TCR-triggered serine esterase release ( XREF_BIBR ), and CTLs with  zeta chain mutations, defective in Ca 2+  signaling, were incapable of killing target cells ( XREF_BIBR ). Confounding these studies  were reports of a Ca 2+ -independent mechanism of killing  ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ), which was eventually shown to be mediated by  FasL/Fas interactions ( XREF_BIBR ). Although discovering Fas solved  the mystery concerning an alternative mechanism of killing  used by CTLs, it did not resolve the role of Ca 2+  used by  these two mechanisms of cytotoxicity.\n\nWe have generated a series of IL-2-dependent, Ag-independent clones (CTL-FDs) that have lost the ability to kill  via the perforin/granule exocytosis mechanism of killing,  although they contain functional perforin and granzymes.  These variants have retained the ability to kill via the FasL/ Fas mechanism of killing and they secrete IFN-gamma. Using  these clones or an altered peptide ligand, we have shown  that distinct TCR signaling events activate perforin versus  FasL/Fas killing ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). In examining the parental 14-7  and the variant 14-7FD clones, we discovered that bypassing early TCR signaling events with phorbol ester and  Ca 2+  ionophore could trigger granule exocytosis in the  variant clone. In addition, CsA inhibited FasL/Fas killing  but not perforin killing. This evidence and the fact that 14-7FD did not display the characteristic biphasic Ca 2+  response after TCR engagement led us to further examine  the role of intracellular and extracellular Ca 2+  in perforin  and FasL/Fas mediated cytotoxicity. \n\nIn this paper, we report that a large biphasic Ca 2+  response is required for perforin killing, whereas a smaller  sustained Ca 2+  influx is sufficient for FasL induction and  killing. We also show that replacing the large [Ca 2+ ] i  flux  in 14-7FD with ionomycin or thapsigargin while stimulating with PMA is enough to trigger perforin granule/exocytosis cytotoxicity. Extracellular Ca 2+  was required for  both perforin and FasL/Fas killing. Lastly, we demonstrate  that differential Ca 2+  signaling can activate FasL/Fas versus  perforin killing. These findings should provide insight into  the role of Ca 2+  in activation of differential TCR signaling  pathways.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nAnti-CD3epsilon Effectively Stimulates Perforin/Granule Exocytosis and FasL/Fas Cytotoxicity in 14-7 and 14-7FD..\n\nWe have  previously reported that distinct TCR signaling events trigger perforin versus FasL/Fas cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Ag/MHC complexes trigger perforin/ granule exocytosis and induce FasL/Fas killing in 14-7, but  only FasL/Fas killing in 14-7FD ( XREF_BIBR ). We had also observed that plate-bound anti-CD3epsilon triggered granule exocytosis and IFN-gamma production in 14-7, whereas it only  stimulated IFN-gamma production in 14-7FD. Since we planned  to use anti-CD3epsilon in our Ca 2+  measurements, we wanted  to confirm that soluble anti-CD3epsilon paralleled the Ag/MHC  response in the CTL killing assays. Fig.  XREF_FIG  shows that anti-CD3epsilon works in a soluble but not a plate-bound fashion to  trigger 14-7 to kill via the perforin mechanism                    .  Anti-CD3epsilon works both in solution and when plate-bound  to trigger granule exocytosis in the presence or absence of  target cells in 14-7 but not in 14-7FD                    . In addition,  anti-CD3epsilon induces both 14-7 and 14-7FD to lyse targets  via the FasL/Fas mechanism                    . In all perforin and  granule exocytosis experiments, the CTLs were pretreated  with 1 mug/ml emetine, an irreversible protein synthesis inhibitor ( XREF_BIBR ), for 5 min before the start of the assay to prevent FasL induction or production of granzyme A ( XREF_BIBR ). In  agreement with our previous work, anti-CD3epsilon stimulated  14-7FD to kill via the FasL/Fas mechanism only                       .  These results demonstrate that soluble anti-CD3epsilon could  substitute for Ag/MHC to trigger perforin and FasL/Fas  cytotoxicity in our model system. \n\n\n\nAnti-CD3epsilon Stimulation Induces Qualitatively and Quantitatively Distinct Ca 2+  Signals in 14-7 and 14-7FD..\n\nWe have  previously reported that 14-7 and 14-7FD differ dramatically in their TCR-stimulated total Ca 2+  response ( XREF_BIBR ), but  in that study we did not distinguish between the intracellular Ca 2+  release and extracellular Ca 2+  influx components  of the response. We next examined the role intra- and extracellular Ca 2+  played in TCR signaling in 14-7 and 14-7FD. 14-7 has a resting Ca 2+  level of ~50 nM, which  peaks at 2 muM within 30 s of TCR stimulation and is sustained at ~1 muM for at least 6 min                    . This TCR-stimulated biphasic Ca 2+  profile is very similar to that observed by others ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). In contrast, 14-7FD has a  much higher resting level of [Ca 2+ ] i  than does 14-7, between 80 and 300 nM                    . When stimulated with  anti-CD3epsilon, 14-7FD does not undergo the characteristic  Ca 2+  response seen in 14-7, but has a slow sustained increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  levels                    . To measure the contribution of released intracellular Ca 2+  to the rise in [Ca 2+ ] i , we  used EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca 2+ . When 14-7 was  stimulated through the TCR in the presence of EGTA, the  intracellular release component was easily detected                    .  In comparison, when 14-7FD was stimulated with anti-CD3epsilon in the presence of EGTA, little to no intracellular  release component was detected                    . To determine  the source of the increase in [Ca 2+ ] i , we did the converse of  the previous experiment and stimulated 14-7FD through the  TCR and then added EGTA. In 14-7, addition of EGTA  after stimulation led to a reduction in [Ca 2+ ] i  with a return  to baseline over the course of ~45 s                    . In comparison, addition of EGTA after anti-CD3epsilon stimulation of 14-7FD resulted in an almost immediate reduction in [Ca 2+ ] i                      . The inorganic Ca 2+  blocker Ni 2+  gave very similar results (data not shown). These results suggest that for  14-7FD the increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  is almost exclusively due to  influx, apparently occurring in the presence of very little to  no release of intracellular Ca 2+ . These results demonstrate  that Ca 2+  signaling in 14-7 and 14-7FD are qualitatively  and quantitatively distinct and provide a correlation between the differential Ca 2+  response and the ability to kill  via the perforin/granule exocytosis or FasL/Fas mechanism, respectively (Figs.  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ).  \n\n\n\nRelease of Intracellular Ca 2+ Induces Influx of Extracellular  Ca 2+  in 14-7FD..\n\nWe next wanted to dissect the Ca 2+   signaling mechanism in 14-7FD. We hypothesized that either there was a defect in the TCR signaling pathway leading to intracellular Ca 2+  release or that there was a failure  of intracellular released Ca 2+  to open plasma membrane Ca 2+   channels. In many cell types extracellular Ca 2+  influx is initiated by the release of intracellular Ca 2+  stores ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ). To  test whether intracellular Ca 2+  release could activate the  Ca 2+  entry pathway in 14-7FD, we used thapsigargin, a  microsomal Ca 2+  pump inhibitor, to deplete intracellular  Ca 2+  stores ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Thapsigargin induces Ca 2+  release  by inhibiting an endoplasmic reticulum(ER) membrane  Ca 2+  ATPase pump that constantly pumps Ca 2+  back into  the ER ( XREF_BIBR ). Thapsigargin induced the release of intracellular Ca 2+  when extracellular Ca 2+  was absent                     in  14-7FD. This intracellular Ca 2+  release induced influx of  extracellular Ca 2+ , as shown by the fact that addition of  EGTA inhibited extracellular Ca 2+  influx                    . These  data provide evidence that differential TCR signaling response in 14-7FD lies upstream of ER Ca 2+  release, not in  intracellular Ca 2+ -induced extracellular Ca 2+  influx. \n\n\n\nCa 2+  Channel Antagonists Inhibit Perforin/Granule Exocytosis and FasL/Fas-mediated Cytotoxicity..\n\nThis differential Ca 2+   signaling in 14-7 and 14-7FD prompted us to further define the extracellular and intracellular Ca 2+  requirements  for perforin and FasL/Fas killing. Several groups have examined the effects of Ca 2+  channel antagonists and Ca 2+   signaling in CTL-mediated killing ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Since the  FasL/Fas-based mechanism of killing was not discovered  until 1993 ( XREF_BIBR ), we sought to reexamine the ability of various Ca 2+  antagonists to inhibit perforin/granule exocytosis  or FasL/Fas-based killing. The L type channel antagonists  (nifedipine, nitrendipine, and verapamil [52]), T type channel antagonists (NDGA [50] and SK&F-96365 [51]), calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine, W7 [60]), Ca 2+  chelator  (EGTA), and Ca 2+  channel blocker Ni 2+  ( XREF_BIBR ) were examined  for their effects on CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. Trifluoperazine and W7 were toxic to the CTL in 4-8-h assays.  EGTA inhibited perforin killing by 14-7 on HA529-pulsed  Fas -  targets                     with an IC 50  between 1 and 5 mM.  Nifedipine, SK&F-96365, and NDGA inhibited perforin  killing                     with IC 50 s of 50-100 muM, 10-50 muM, and  5-10 muM, respectively                    . These data demonstrate  the requirement for influx of extracellular Ca 2+  in perforin  killing and extend the original observations to include new,  more T cell-selective, T type Ca 2+  channel antagonists. \n\nWe tested the same panel of inhibitors for the ability to  inhibit anti-CD3epsilon-triggered granule exocytosis in a target  cell-independent assay. In concordance with our perforin  killing assay, nifedipine, SK&F-96365, NDGA, and EGTA  all inhibited granule exocytosis with similar IC 50 s as had  been seen in the perforin-killing assay                    . Ni 2+  also  inhibited TCR-triggered granule exocytosis (reference  XREF_BIBR   and data not shown). These data indicate that extracellular  Ca 2+  is required for granule exocytosis killing and that both  T and L type selective antagonists can inhibit granule exocytosis.\n\nHistorically, the FasL/Fas mechanism of killing was discovered as being a Ca 2+  independent mechanism of killing  ( XREF_BIBR ). These initial reports were somewhat contradictory to  our finding that CsA inhibited TCR induced FasL/Fas killing, since it is widely known that CsA acts on calcineurin, a  Ca 2+ -dependent phosphatase ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Since 14-7/14-7FD  provides a unique system to address this issue, we screened  the same panel of Ca 2+  antagonists for their ability to block  TCR-induced FasL/Fas killing by 14-7FD. Normally,  TCR engagement induces signals that lead to induction of  the FasL gene. Once FasL is expressed, the CTL can lyse  Fas-expressing targets. EGTA, NDGA, and SK&F-96365  inhibited TCR-induced FasL/Fas killing with IC 50 s slightly  higher than those required to inhibit perforin killing                     . In contrast to its effect on perforin killing, nifedipine had  no effect on TCR-induced FasL/Fas killing                    . To  confirm that extracellular Ca 2+  was required to induce FasL  expression in 14-7, we screened Ni 2+  and the panel of inhibitors for the ability to inhibit anti-CD3epsilon-induced FasL  expression as detected by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.   XREF_FIG  d, Ni 2+ , EGTA, SK&F-96365, and NDGA inhibited induction of FasL expression, whereas nifedipine was ineffective                    . These data demonstrate that extracellular  Ca 2+  influx is required for TCR-triggered perforin lysis,  granule exocytosis, and FasL expression, as well as FasL/Fas  killing.\n\n\n\nA Large Increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  Is Required for Perforin Killing..\n\nWe next wanted to test whether a Ca 2+  agonist in combination either with PMA or a TCR signal could restore the  large increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  in 14-7FD and therefore restore  perforin/granule exocytosis killing. Using either thapsigargin or ionomycin to induce an increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  in conjunction with anti-CD3epsilon or Ag/MHC stimulation, we examined granule exocytosis                        and perforin killing                            . As previously seen, anti-CD3epsilon triggers  granule exocytosis in 14-7, but not in 14-7FD                            . Both the combination of PMA and ionomycin and  that of PMA and thapsigargin trigger granule exocytosis for  both 14-7 and 14-7FD                           . Ionomycin alone  induces a small yet significant secretion of granzyme A in  14-7FD                    . We then tested the ability of ionomycin  and thapsigargin to work in combination with anti-CD3epsilon  or Ag/MHC to trigger granule exocytosis. Ionomycin or  thapsigargin with either anti-CD3epsilon or Ag/MHC does not  significantly trigger granule exocytosis in 14-7FD over ionomycin or thapsigargin alone                           . These data  indicate that mimicking the large [Ca 2+ ] i  increase with ionomycin or thapsigargin in combination with PMA could  restore perforin/granule exocytosis killing in 14-7FD, whereas  ionomycin or thapsigargin in combination with a TCR  signal was not sufficient. This suggests that other TCR signals in addition to the functional TCR signaling pathways  in 14-7FD and Ca 2+  are required for perforin killing by  14-7FD. \n\nTo confirm that PMA plus ionomycin or thapsigargin  triggered perforin killing as well as granule exocytosis in  14-7FD, we used the same combinations of ionomycin or  thapsigargin with either PMA or HA529-pulsed Fas -  targets in a cytotoxicity assay. As previously seen, 14-7 killed  the HA529 pulsed Fas -  target, but 14-7FD did not (Figs.  XREF_FIG   and  XREF_FIG , e and f). Both PMA and ionomycin and PMA and  thapsigargin activated both 14-7 and 14-7FD to kill via the  perforin mechanism                           . Neither HA529 and  ionomycin nor HA529 and thapsigargin significantly induced perforin killing over ionomycin or thapsigargin  alone for 14-7FD                    . Additionally, ionomycin alone  induced significant killing by both 14-7 and 14-7FD                            . In summary, these data suggest that an increase  in [Ca 2+ ] i  is required for perforin killing.\n\n\n\nDifferential Ca 2+  Signaling Activates Perforin Versus FasL/ Fas Killing..\n\nLastly, we wanted to determine if altering  Ca 2+  signaling in 14-7 with ionomycin or thapsigargin  could differentially activate FasL/Fas versus perforin killing,  in much the same way that TCR signaling selectively activates FasL/Fas killing in 14-7FD. First, we examined the  effect of various concentrations of ionomycin or thapsigargin on Ca 2+  mobilization and influx in 14-7 to see if we  could find a concentration that mimicked the TCR-induced  Ca 2+  response in 14-7FD. Ionomycin gave a concentration-dependent decrease in the magnitude of the response                     . Although the magnitude of the response decreases  with lower amounts of ionomycin, the Ca 2+  response  maintained its biphasic appearance                    . Thapsigargin,  on the other hand, gives a quantitatively and qualitatively  different response than ionomycin                    . The maximal  response with thapsigargin raises [Ca 2+ ] i  levels to 900 nM,  whereas ionomycin gives a maximal [Ca 2+ ] i  response of  ~2000 nM                           . The ionomycin [Ca 2+ ] i  response in 14-7 looks very similar to the biphasic TCR-triggered response (Figs.  XREF_FIG  a and 6 a). In comparison, the maximal thapsigargin [Ca 2+ ] i  response peaks at ~800 nM and is  maintained at >700 nM                    . At lower concentrations, between 10 and 200 nM, the ionomycin [Ca 2+ ] i  response is quantitatively lower, but qualitatively similar, retaining a biphasic profile                    . Thapsigargin, on the  other hand, induces a quantitatively and qualitatively different response at lower concentrations than did ionomycin                     . Between 1 and 20 nM, thapsigargin induces a  Ca 2+  response that did not have a fast initial increase, but  induces a slow rise in [Ca 2+ ] i                     . Interestingly, this  Ca 2+  response looks remarkably like the TCR-triggered  Ca 2+  response in 14-7FD (Figs.  XREF_FIG  b and 6 b). These results  demonstrate that ionomycin and thapsigargin can induce  quantitatively and qualitatively different Ca 2+  signals. \n\nWe next wanted to determine whether these different  Ca 2+  signals that had been generated with ionomycin and  thapsigargin have functional consequences in regulating  perforin or FasL/Fas killing. In other words, can we use  ionomycin or thapsigargin to make 14-7 act like 14-7FD  with regard to CTL effector function? Using ionomycin or  thapsigargin at various concentrations, we assayed for granule exocytosis and lysis of Fas +  targets. At concentrations  up to 100 nM, thapsigargin induces FasL/Fas killing in the  absence of granule exocytosis, but ionomycin does not                            . The concentrations of thapsigargin that selectively induced FasL/Fas killing corresponds exactly with  those that give a [Ca 2+ ] i  response that resembles the 14-7FD TCR-triggered Ca 2+  response (Figs.  XREF_FIG , b, and 6, b and  d). At higher concentrations of thapsigargin, both perforin/ granule exocytosis and FasL/Fas killing are induced. In  contrast, ionomycin always induced both types of killing                     . These data demonstrated that we could make  14-7 behave like 14-7FD by stimulation with low amounts  of thapsigargin.\n\nFig.  XREF_FIG , a and b, demonstrates that the selective blocking of  perforin cytolysis using nifedipine seen for clone 14-7                             can be extended to additional CD8 +  CTL  clones, 11-1 and 14-13. The inability of low concentrations of ionomycin to trigger both granule exocytosis                      and FasL/Fas cytolysis                     also holds for clones  11-1 and 14-13. Low concentrations of thapsigargin trigger  cytolysis                     in the absence of significant granule exocytosis                    . That this cytolysis is FasL/Fas mediated is  demonstrated by inhibition seen in the presence of anti-FasL  antibody                    . In summary, these data demonstrate  that quantitatively and qualitatively distinct Ca 2+  signals can  differentially activate FasL/Fas versus perforin cytotoxicity. \n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nWe have previously reported that distinct TCR signal  transduction pathways activate perforin versus FasL/Fas  killing ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). This study demonstrated that soluble anti-CD3epsilon worked as effectively as Ag/MHC to trigger perforin killing by 14-7                    . This is most likely due to  the fact that L1210 expresses an FcR ( XREF_BIBR ), which allows a  close physical proximity between the CTL and the target.  Cell to cell contact is required for the lethal hit as plate-bound anti-CD3epsilon was ineffective in triggering killing                   , although it efficiently initiated granule exocytosis                     . In comparison, soluble or plate-bound anti-CD3epsilon or  Ag/MHC effectively induced FasL/Fas killing                    ,  leading us to believe that the physical interaction between  the CTL and the target is not as critical for FasL/Fas killing  as it is for perforin killing. In either case, anti-CD3epsilon mimicked the effect of Ag/MHC in our 14-7/14-7FD system.\n\nTo further dissect the TCR signaling differences between 14-7 and 14-7FD, we examined Ca 2+  signaling in  the two clones. It was apparent that the TCR-triggered  Ca 2+  signal in 14-7FD was qualitatively and quantitatively  different from that of 14-7                           . 14-7 had a typical biphasic response, characterized by a large transient increase followed by a sustained plateau phase                    . In  contrast, 14-7FD did not have a biphasic response, but had  a small (50-100 nM), sustained increase                    . Additionally the resting level of [Ca 2+ ] i  in 14-7FD was consistently higher than that in 14-7, ranging anywhere from 80  to 300 nM (Figs.  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG ). To determine if the slow increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  in 14-7FD was coming from intracellular  stores, extracellular influx, or both we examined the effect  of treating the CTL with EGTA before or after TCR triggering. Adding EGTA before TCR engagement in 14-7  revealed that the large transient [Ca 2+ ] i  increase is made up  of both intracellular (20%) and extracellular (80%) Ca 2+                      , whereas the plateau phase is made up of almost  entirely extracellular Ca 2+  influx                    . Adding EGTA  before TCR stimulation almost completely inhibited the  Ca 2+  response in 14-7FD                    , whereas adding EGTA  after stimulation revealed that a large component of the  Ca 2+  response was mediated by extracellular Ca 2+  influx                     . The 50-100-nM Ca 2+  response in 14-7FD is  near the limits of sensitivity of our instrument, and a small  but functional intracellular response such as a \"Ca 2+  puff\"  from the ER as has been described by M. Berridge ( XREF_BIBR ) can  not be ruled out, especially considering that the Ca 2+  response in 14-7 stimulated with low doses of thapsigargin  looks very similar to the TCR response in 14-7FD                     . Nevertheless, the qualitatively and quantitatively distinct  Ca 2+  signaling patterns in 14-7FD make it a unique CTL  for examining the role Ca 2+  plays in activating and regulating CTL effector functions.\n\nWe next wanted to determine if the Ca 2+  signaling defect in 14-7FD was at the level of activating intracellular  Ca 2+  release or if there was a defect in the Ca 2+  release-activated Ca 2+  influx pathway as has been described in mutant  Jurkat cells ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Using the Ca 2+  ATPase ER pump inhibitor thapsigargin, in the presence of EGTA demonstrated  that 14-7FD had a functional intracellular store of Ca 2+                      . Additionally, it could be demonstrated that release of Ca 2+  from this pool activated the Ca 2+  influx pathway                     . These results suggest that the signaling defect lies  upstream of ER Ca 2+  release along the pathway between  TCR stimulation, phospholipase C activation, and inositol  triphosphate production and binding.\n\nAlthough it is apparent that differential TCR signaling is  occurring in 14-7FD, as of yet we do not know the reason  why. 14-7FD has equivalent levels of TCR, CD45, CD8alpha/beta,  CD3epsilon, zeta, Lck, Fyn, ZAP70, PLCgamma1, and MAPK (Esser,  M.T., unpublished observations), but we have not yet  tested the TCR-triggered activity of these known signaling  intermediates. One possible explanation for the signaling  defect in 14-7FD is that the higher resting level of [Ca 2+ ] i   modulates the activity of early TCR signaling kinases and  phosphatases, preventing \"full activation\". Another explanation  is that a key signaling event such as zeta chain phosphorylation or Fyn kinase activation is not occurring in 14-7FD.  From other studies, we know that differential tyrosine kinase activity occurs after TCR engagement in 14-7FD as  compared with 14-7 (Esser, M.T., unpublished observations).  How these early tyrosine kinase signaling events regulate  perforin versus FasL/Fas killing is not known.\n\nSince FasL/Fas killing had originally been reported to be  Ca 2+  independent, we used our 14-7/14-7FD CTL to test  the intracellular Ca 2+  release and Ca 2+  influx requirements  for perforin/granule exocytosis and FasL/Fas killing. The L  type Ca 2+  channel antagonist verapamil had no effect on  perforin killing as had been seen by Gray et al. ( XREF_BIBR ) or  FasL/Fas killing (data not shown). Interestingly, the L type  antagonist nifedipine inhibited perforin killing but not  FasL/Fas killing                  . Our results confirm the findings  by Sitkovsky et al. that extracellular Ca 2+  is required for  granule exocytosis ( XREF_BIBR ) and extend these observations by  characterizing the T type Ca 2+  channel antagonists NDGA  and SK&F-96365, both of which inhibited perforin killing.  The extracellular Ca 2+  requirement for granule exocytosis  is most likely due to the fact that the large initial increase in  [Ca 2+ ] i  mediates the cytoskeletal changes required for granule exocytosis is comprised of 70-80% extracellular Ca 2+                      . These cytoskeletal changes occur at ~200 nM,  can occur in the presence of CsA ( XREF_BIBR ), and may explain  why perforin killing is CsA insensitive ( XREF_BIBR ). We also found  that extracellular Ca 2+  is required for the induction of FasL  expression                     as well as FasL/Fas killing                    .  These results extend the observations of Vignaux, who first  showed that Ca 2+  is required for the induction of FasL, but  once expressed, FasL/Fas killing is Ca 2+  independent ( XREF_BIBR ).  From Fig.  XREF_FIG  d it appears that higher concentrations of the  antagonists are required to inhibit killing than are required  to inhibit expression of FasL. We do not find this surprising  in light of our findings and those of others, that neither the  level of FasL or Fas correlate with the levels of killing ( XREF_BIBR ,   XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ). Our data suggests that the initial peak of TCR-stimulated increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  is required for cytoskeletal  changes and perforin/granule exocytosis, whereas the sustained influx is sufficient for calcineurin activation, NFATc  translocation to the nucleus, and FasL gene transcription.\n\nSince PMA and ionomycin induced granzyme A exocytosis in 14-7FD                  , we wanted to determine if replacing the increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  (via ionomycin or thapsigargin)  in the presence of a TCR signal could induce perforin/ granule exocytosis. Using Ag/MHC or anti-CD3epsilon plus  ionomycin or thapsigargin did not restored perforin/granule exocytosis killing in 14-7FD, suggesting that in addition to a strong Ca 2+  signal other signaling events lacking  in 14-7FD are required to induce perforin/granule exocytosis killing                  . Since we could restore perforin-mediated cytotoxicity with PMA and ionomycin or thapsigargin  we asked if we could selectively induce FasL/Fas killing  without triggering perforin killing. Low doses of thapsigargin induced FasL/Fas killing without triggering perforin/ granule exocytosis in 14-7                    . Concentrations of  thapsigargin which selectively activated FasL/Fas killing  were qualitatively different in the time course and extent to  which they increased [Ca 2+ ] i  than were higher concentrations that activated perforin killing. At lower concentrations, thapsigargin induced a slow sustained increase in  [Ca 2+ ] i  that looked very similar to the TCR-stimulated  changes in [Ca 2+ ] i  in 14-7FD (Figs.  XREF_FIG  b and 6 b). These results suggest that qualitatively and quantitatively distinct  Ca 2+  signals can differentially activate CTL effector functions.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative and qualitative Ca 2+  signaling differences in 14-7FD, there could also be spatial  and temporal differences in Ca 2+  signaling. Studies performed by Gray et al. revealed that following Ag/MHC  engagement, Ca 2+  mobilization from intracellular stores  occurred at a site distal to target cell contact and was transient ( XREF_BIBR ), whereas extracellular Ca 2+  influx occurred proximal to the T cell-target interface, was prolonged, and oscillated with a periodicity of 3-4 min ( XREF_BIBR ). These early  studies demonstrate the need to examine the magnitude,  duration, and subcellular localization of the Ca 2+  response  in 14-7 and 14-7FD. These studies should provide new  understanding into the mechanisms of Ca 2+  regulated cytotoxicity and gene transcription.\n\nIn summary, our present findings demonstrate that signaling via the TCR is a dynamic process, allowing perforin/granule exocytosis and FasL/Fas killing to be independently activated. A large transient increase in [Ca 2+ ] i  is  required for perforin killing, whereas sustained Ca 2+  influx  appears to be both necessary and sufficient for induction of  FasL/Fas killing. This differential Ca 2+  signaling allows selective activation of FasL/Fas versus perforin killing and  may represent a mechanism that lymphocytes use to selectively activate different effector functions, proliferation, or  death. By modulating these TCR signal transduction pathways, the immune system could selectively execute (perforin) or downregulate (FasL/Fas) a cellular immune response.\n\n",
