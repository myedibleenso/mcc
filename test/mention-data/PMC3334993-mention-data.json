      "text":"Vimentin and PSF Act in Concert to Regulate IbeA+ E. coli K1 Induced Activation and Nuclear Translocation of NF-kappaB in Human Brain Endothelial Cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground.\n\nIbeA-induced NF-kappaB signaling through its primary receptor vimentin as well as its co-receptor PSF is required for meningitic E. coli K1 penetration and leukocyte transmigration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which are the hallmarks of bacterial meningitis. However, it is unknown how vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which are required for bacteria-mediated pathogenicities.\n\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings.\n\nIbeA-induced E. coli K1 invasion, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) transmigration and IKK/NF-kappaB activation are blocked by Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an inhibitor of NF-kappaB. IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation is blocked by ERK inhibitors. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that vimentin forms a complex with IkappaB, NF-kappaB and tubulins in the resting cells. A dissociation of this complex and a simultaneous association of PSF with NF-kappaB could be induced by IbeA in a time-dependent manner. The head domain of vimentin is required for the complex formation. Two cytoskeletal components, vimentin filaments and microtubules, contribute to the regulation of NF-kappaB. SiRNA-mediated knockdown studies demonstrate that IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation is completely abolished in HBMECs lacking vimentin and PSF. Phosphorylation of ERK and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB are entirely dependent on PSF. These findings suggest that vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB activation. PSF is essential for translocation of NF-kappaB and ERK to the nucleus.\n\n\n\nConclusion/Significance.\n\nThese findings reveal previously unappreciated facets of the IbeA-binding proteins. Cooperative contributions of vimentin and PSF to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB may represent a new paradigm in pathogen-induced signal transduction and lead to the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of bacterial meningitis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nOver the past few years, studies of the common neonatal bacterial meningitis caused by Escherichia coli K1 revealed the importance and significance of IbeA, a major virulence determinant during the early stage of neonatal E. coli infection  XREF_BIBR , and its interactions with host factors in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), including vimentin (primary receptor), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)-associated splicing factor (PSF) (co-receptor), and related signaling molecules (e.g., caveolin-1, ERK, and CaMKII)  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . The ibeA gene locus (GimA) is unique to E. coli pathogens but is not present in nonpathogenic E. coli K12 strains  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . It has been widely used as a genetic marker in the genotyping of E. coli strains isolated from various host and environmental sources  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . The ibeA locus is able to modulate expression of several virulence factors (e.g., aatA, fim, ibeB, ompA and biofilm-associated genes) and predominantly contributes to E. coli K1-caused early-onset human neonatal sepsis and meningitis by inducing both pathogen penetration and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) transmigration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which consists mainly of BMEC  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . IbeA is positively associated with multidrug resistance  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . The specific IbeA-BMEC surface protein interaction and subsequently induced signal transduction were shown to be essential for E. coli K1 invasion  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Two IbeA-binding proteins have been identified: vimentin, which is constitutively present in the surface of human BMECs (HBMECs), and PSF, which is inducibly expressed in both mesenchymal (endothelium) and non-mesenchymal (epithelium) cells  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . IbeA-induced signaling through its binding proteins vimentin as well as PSF is required for meningitic E. coli K1 penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is one of the hallmarks of bacterial meningitis  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Vimentin is a well-known marker for mesenchymal cells such as endothelial cells  XREF_BIBR . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes are usually associated with embryonic development and the malignant conversion of epithelial tumour cells  XREF_BIBR . This protein also contributes to the adhesive or invasive phenotype of microbial pathogens, including P. multocida and African swine fever virus  XREF_BIBR . Our previous studies have shown that CaMKII-induced phosphorylation of the vimentin head domain and the vimentin-binding domain of ERK are necessary for IbeA+ E. coli K1-mediated invasion of BMEC. PSF is mainly present in the nucleus, but it can be translocated to the cytoplasm and cell surface  XREF_BIBR . It has multiple functions, including binding of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins, DNA pairing, promotion of pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. Besides these properties, PSF may contribute to regulation of protein kinase C  XREF_BIBR  and ERK  XREF_BIBR . Our recent study demonstrated that PSF could contribute to IbeA-mediated E. coli K1 invasion of HBMECs in a manner dependent on lipid rafts  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . Upon stimulation with E. coli K1 or IbeA-coated beads, vimentin and PSF are recruited to the raft microdomains, suggesting that that lipid rafts in HBMECs serve as a common platform for both proteins contributing to IbeA-induced virulence. However, it is unknown how vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to IbeA-induced cellular signaling and bacterial invasion.\n\nOur recent studies have demonstrated that the IbeA/Vim-mediated signaling is essential for NF-kappaB activation and PMN transmigration across the BBB, two additional hallmark features of bacterial meningitis  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . There is a dual role for PMN recruitment to the CNS. PMN transmigration across the BBB is not only a key aspect of the protective response against invading pathogens, but leukocytes also contribute importantly to the deleterious effects of inflammation on the CNS tissues in bacterial meningitis, which results in devastating neurologic sequelae  XREF_BIBR . Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that IbeA and vimentin are essential for E. coli K1-induced PMN transmigration across the BBB. Vimentin on both endothelial cells and PMN is able to form an anchoring structure at the site of contact between these two cell types. Vimentin contributes to PMN transmigration across the BBB in response to meningitic infection in a manner substantially similar to the traversal of lymphocytes across peripheral endothelial cells  XREF_BIBR . E. coli-induced PMN transmigration could be markedly inhibited by withaferin A, a dual inhibitor of vimentin and proteasome. IbeA-induced PMN migration could be also blocked by PS-341 (bortezomib), a proteasomal inhibitor, and correlated with up-regulation of vimentin, ICAM-1, and CD44 expression through proteasomal regulation of NF-kappaB activity  XREF_BIBR . Vimentin could stabilize adhesion molecules and Scribble by protecting them from proteasomal degradation  XREF_BIBR . These findings suggest that IbeA is able to induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and upregulate vimentin that are correlated with E. coli K1-stimulated PMN transendothelial migration and inflammatory response. Currently, it remains elusive how IbeA contributes to both bacterial invasion and PMN transmigration through its interactions with vimentin/PSF and upregulation of NF-kappaB activity.\n\nThe NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway, which is the master regulator of the innate immunity, plays important roles in maintaining cell homeostasis/differentiation, and regulating the host response to microbial infections  XREF_BIBR . NF-kappaB proteins consist of five different members, p65/RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB2/p52, and NF-kappaB1/p50, sharing a Rel homology domain that mediates DNA binding and dimerization  XREF_BIBR . In resting cells, NF-kappaB is trapped in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IkappaB proteins. The NF-kappaB activation process is induced by phosphorylation of serine residues on the IkappaB proteins, which are then subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Deregulated activity of this pathway has been linked to the progression of a number of human diseases, including cancers and microbial infections  XREF_BIBR . For example, NF-kappaB activation has been shown to contribute to N. meningitidis invasion of epithelial cells  XREF_BIBR  and H. pylori-induced inflammation in gastric epithelium  XREF_BIBR . NF-kappaB in the CNS is activated during bacterial meningitis  XREF_BIBR . NF-kappaB inhibitors have been found to reduce the CNS inflammation and to protect rat brains from inflammatory injury following transient focal cerebral ischemia  XREF_BIBR  and pneumacoccal meningitis  XREF_BIBR . Our studies suggest that IbeA induces all three of the hallmark features of bacterial meningitis: NF-kappaB activation, pathogen invasion and PMN transmigration across the BBB  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . The underlying mechanisms for these pathogenicities, however, require further investigation. Recently, vimentin has emerged as a signaling platform of a number of critical proteins at the cell surface, which contribute to the invasive phenotypes of cancer, E. coli-induced pathogenicities, and cell signaling  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . PSF's main function as a nuclear protein is to contribute to the promotion of pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . These findings suggest that vimentin and PSF may cooperatively contribute to the early and late signaling events induced by IbeA, allowing us to speculate that NF-kappaB activation is mainly mediated by vimentin and that PSF plays a major role in both cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. To clarify these issues, we investigated in this study the role of vimentin and PSF in IbeA-induced NF-kappaB signaling.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nIbeA-induced E. coli K1 invasion, PMN transmigration and IKK/NF-kappaB activation are blocked in vitro and in vivo by Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an inhibitor of NF-kappaB.\n\nOur previous studies suggest that NF-kappaB activation may play a key role in IbeA-induced bacterial invasion and PMN transmigration  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In order to dissect this issue, CAPE, a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB, was used to determine the role of NF-kappaB signaling in both IbeA+ E. coli K1 induced Invasion and PMN transmigration. As shown in  XREF_FIG , IbeA+ E. coli (E44) could significantly increase phosphorylation of IKK alpha/beta and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus when compared to the IbeA deletion mutant ZD1 and the control without treatment. These cellular effects were remarkably reduced by inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling with CAPE. CAPE could also significantly block IbeA+ E. coli K1 (E44)-induced invasion of HBMECs and PMN transmigration in a dose-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ). However, the dose-dependent effects on PMN transmigration could not be observed with the ibeA mutant ZD1 under the same experimental conditions ( XREF_FIG ). Residual effects of CAPE-mediated inhibition on ZD1 were also observed, indicating that other virulence factors might be regulated by NF-kappaB. To further confirm these in vitro findings, mice were pre-treated with CAPE for 3 days and then infected with E44. As shown in  XREF_FIG , CAPE was able to significantly reduce the levels of PMN, albumin and NF-kappaB in CSF. Overall, these findings suggest that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway plays an important role in IbeA+ E. coli K1 induced Invasion and PMN transmigration across HBMECs.\n\n\n\nMEK/ERK signaling mediates IKK complex and NF-kappaB activation in response to IbeA+ E. coli K1 infection of HBMECs.\n\nThe MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, a chain of proteins communicating a signal from a receptor on the cell surface to the DNA in the nucleus, has been implicated in NF-kappaB activation in response to Ras activation  XREF_BIBR  or anthracycline drug treatment  XREF_BIBR . We have demonstrated that ERK phosphorylation is required for IbeA-induced E. coli K1 invasion  XREF_BIBR . Binding of vimentin to phospho-ERK can protect the activated kinase from dephosphorylation  XREF_BIBR . PSF contributes to IGF-I-mediated regulation of ERK through association and dissociation of p-ERK  XREF_BIBR . Thus, we sought to determine whether IbeA-ERK activation could also promote activation of NF-kappaB through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. PD098059, an ERK inhibitor, was first used to examine the role of ERK phosphorylation in IbeA+ E. coli-induced NF-kappaB activation.  XREF_FIG  showed that E44 could increase phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and IKK alpha/beta, degradation of IkappaBalpha after 30 min of incubation, and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus after 2 h of infection when compared to the IbeA deletion mutant ZD1 and the control without treatment. We then used synthetic ERK peptides ERK89 (vimentin-binding domain) and ERK312 (non-binding peptide) to examine whether the vimentin-binding domain of ERK was essential for IbeA+ E. coli-induced NF-kappaB activation. As shown in  XREF_FIG , ERK89 was able to block the Erk1/2 and IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus when compared to the control peptide ERK312. It suggests that the regulation of ERK by vimentin is important for IbeA+ E. coli-induced NF-kappaB activation based on its protection effect on ERK phosphorylation. Taken in consideration together, these results demonstrated that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is critical for IbeA+ E. coli K1-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.\n\n\n\nIbeA+ E. coli K1 induced NF-kappaB activation is vimentin-dependent.\n\nSince IbeA+ E. coli K1 was able to induce extensive vimentin reorganization in HMBECs  XREF_BIBR , we assumed that this change was involved with IbeA+ E. coli K1-induced NF-kappaB activation. In order to dissect this issue, immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine the colocalization of vimentin and NF-kappaB.  XREF_FIG  showed that there were very few changes in vimentin reorganization and NF-kappaB translocation occurring in the control without any treatment or HBMECs treated with the IbeA deletion mutant ZD1 after 2 hours of incubation, while E44 and IbeA could strongly induce both vimentin rearrangements and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus. The cytoplasmic NF-kappaB is clustered and colocalized with vimentin rearrangements (indicated by arrows). We used siRNA-mediated knockdown to further examine the role of vimentin in IbeA+ E. coli K1-induced NF-kappaB activation. As shown in  XREF_FIG , cytoplasmic levels of vimentin, alpha7 nAChR and PSF were significantly reduced in vimentin siRNA-transfected cells. Erk1/2 and IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus were significantly reduced in all treatments of HBMECs transfected with vimentin siRNA. These results suggest that vimentin is required for IbeA+ E. coli K1-induced NF-kappaB activation.\n\n\n\nTime course analysis of IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.\n\nAs shown in our previous studies  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , vimentin and PSF may play sequential roles in the early and late signaling events induced by IbeA. Because the mechanisms by which IbeA induces signaling are still poorly understood and the molecular players responsible for the initiation of NF-kappaB activation and subsequent nuclear translocation are not clear, we performed time course analysis of IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation and translocation. HBMECs were treated with IbeA at different time points (2-24 h). Since vimentin is the primary receptor of IbeA, we first examined its interactions with PSF, NF-kappaB and other signaling molecules by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of vimentin and NF-kappaB (p65). The protein lysates from cytoplasmic fractions were examined and used as positive controls for Co-IP assays. As shown in  XREF_FIG , IbeA could increase expression of vimentin, alpha7 nAChR, and PSF, phosphorylation of IKK alpha/beta, and degradation of IkappaBalpha in the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, IbeA also significantly enhance the protein content of p65 in nuclear fractions and PSF in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in a time-dependent manner. The Co-IP assay with a mouse monoclonal antibody against vimentin showed that proteins in the Co-IP complex including NF-kappaB (p65), IkappaB, and beta-tubulin decreased in a time-dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ), while IbeA could markedly enhance vimentin expression. However, PSF was dramatically increased upon prolonged stimulation with IbeA. These results suggested that there was an increased dissociation of vimentin with IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaB and beta-tubulin, meanwhile an association of vimentin with PSF was increased throughout the time course of stimulation with IbeA. Similar patterns of changes in vimentin, IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaB, beta-tubulin and PSF were observed in the Co-IP assay with the rabbit anti-p65 antibody ( XREF_FIG ). These findings suggest that vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to the early (cytoplasmic activation) and late (nuclear translocation) events of IbeA-induced NF-kappaB signaling. It appears that vimentin forms a complex with IkappaB, NF-kappaB and tubulins in the resting cells. A dissociation of this complex and a simultaneous association of PSF with NF-kappaB could be induced upon the prolonged stimulation with IbeA.\n\n\n\nVimentin head domain is required for IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation and interaction with beta-tubulin.\n\nTo dissect the interaction between vimentin and NF-kappaB (p65) or beta-tubulin, we generated two lentivirus constructs with GFP fusion, which express the vimentin head domain (GFP-VH) in N-terminal and the vimentin rod and tail domains with a VH deletion (GFP-VRT) in C-terminal as described in Materials and Methods\n XREF_BIBR . The lysates of the lentivirus transduced HBMECs were first subjected to Western blot to examine expression of the vimentin fragment constructs. As shown in  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY , a 72-kDa protein (band a) in the GFP-VRT transductant, a 37-kDa protein (band b) in the GFP-VH transductant, and a 27-kDa protein (band c) in the GFP transductant were detected by a rabbit antibody against GFP. Because the two anti-vimentin antibodies recognize the C-terminal region (V9) and the N-terminal region (H84)  XREF_BIBR , respectively, we used them to detect the endogenous expression of vimentin fragments. The results showed a 72-kDa protein (band a) in the GFP-VRT transductant besides the native vimentin of 55-kDa (band d) in all transduced cells with the V9 antibody, and a 37-kDa protein (band b) in the GFP-VH transductant besides the native vimentin of 55-kDa (band d) in all transduced cells with the H84 antibody. Since the Co-IP assays indicated that vimentin could form a complex with IkappaB, NF-kappaB (p65) and beta-tubulin in the resting cells, we then performed a Co-IP assay with a mouse monoclonal antibody against GFP tag using all the transduced HBMECs without any treatment. The GFP-IP complexes were detected with a rabbit antibody against GFP, a rabbit antibody against NF-kappaB (p65), and a rabbit antibody against beta-tubulin ( XREF_FIG ). The results showed a similar pattern to those in  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY  using the GFP antibody, except some cleavages of GFP-VRT and GFP-VH, perhaps due to the instability of the GFP fusion proteins. Interestingly, both NF-kappaB (p65) and beta-tubulin bind to the N-terminal region, suggesting that the vimentin head domain contributes to IbeA-induced NF-kappaB signaling in a coordinated manner with microtubules. In order to further examine the role of the VH domain in IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation, the immunofluorescence microscopy was next used to examine the effects of the VH deletion on NF-kappaB (p65) translocation to the nucleus. The GFP transductant was taken as a positive control. As shown in  XREF_FIG , IbeA-induced NF-kappaB (p65) translocation to the nucleus occurred in both the non-transduced HBMECs and GFP-transduced HBMECs (indicated by arrows), suggesting that the GFP lentivirus transduction did not affect the NF-kappaB pathway. However, the GFP-VRT transductant was deficient in NF-kappaB (p65) translocation to the nucleus (indicated by arrows), indicating that the vimentin head domain is essential for IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation. The same results were also obtained with these transductants upon IbeA+ E. coli (E44) infection, but these events could not occur in the untreated controls of the GFP-VRT and GFP transductants or the cells treated with ZD1. This further confirmed the key role of the VH domain in this process ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). Western blot showed that the VH domain deletion significantly inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway, including Erk1/2 and IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus upon stimulation with both the IbeA protein ( XREF_FIG ) and IbeA+ E. coli (E44), but it did not occur in the cells treated with ZD1 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). To further investigate the interaction between vimentin and NF-kappaB-IkappaB complex, a pull-down assay was performed using purified His-vimentin and Ni-NTA resin column after incubation with total cell lysates of HBMEC. As Shown in  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY , IkappaBalpha ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) could directly bind to vimentin when compared to the control with the Ni-NTA resin only. All these findings suggest the involvement of vimentin in IkappaBalpha binding and the role of the vimentin head domain in IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation.\n\n\n\nMicrotubule network is required for IbeA+ E. coli K1-induced NF-kappaB activation.\n\nThe GFP-tag Co-IP assay demonstrated that beta-tublulin could bind to the vimentin head domain, suggesting that these two kinds of cytoskeletal filaments may coordinately contribute to NF-kappaB signaling. Microtubules have been implicated in NF-kappaB activation and translocation  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . Thus, we further examined the role of the microtubule network in IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine colocalization of vimentin and beta-tubulin upon stimulation with E44, ZD1 and IbeA. As shown in  XREF_FIG , both E44 and IbeA could strongly induced beta-tubulin reorganization, which was partially colocalized with vimentin clusters around the perinuclear region (arrows indicated), while very few colocalization areas were detected in unstimulated cells or cells treated with ZD1. To confirm whether the microtubule network participates in IbeA-induced NF-kappaB signaling, microtubule inhibitors, including colchicine, vincristine, and nocodazole, were used to examine their inhibitory effects on IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation. As shown in  XREF_FIG , all these microtubule inhibitors could block Erk1/2 and IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation, and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus, indicating that the microtubule network plays an important role IbeA+ E. coli-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.\n\n\n\nIbeA+ E. coli K1-induced pathogenicities, phosphorylation of ERK/IKK and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB were significantly blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of PSF.\n\nAs shown in  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_FIG , PSF might contribute to nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Thus, it is interesting to examine whether IbeA-induced pathogenicities, activation of the key signaling molecules (e.g., ERK and IKK) and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB could be blocked by knockdown of PSF. IbeA+ E. coli K1 penetration ( XREF_FIG ) and PMN transmigration across HBMECs ( XREF_FIG ) were significantly inhibited by suppression of PSF expression when compared to that of the ibeA mutant ZD1. Since PSF is mainly present in the nuclei of resting cells and recruited to the cell surface or raft microdomains upon stimulation with IbeA+ E. coli K1, it is necessary to examine its distribution in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. We performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of PSF in HBMECs to examine the role of this protein in IbeA+ E. coli-induced NF-kappaB signaling. As shown in  XREF_FIG , cytoplasm and nucleus were completely devoid of PSF in siRNA-treated HBMECs. PSF siRNA was able to completely inhibit Erk1/2 and IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus, suggesting that PSF plays an essential role in the signals for NF-kappaB activation/translocation that are conveyed between the cytoplasm and nucleus. It has been suggested that the cytoplasmic relocalization of PSF is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation  XREF_BIBR . We, therefore, examined whether IbeA was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PSF using the Co-IP assay with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in  XREF_FIG , tyrosine phosphorylation of PSF was significantly increased upon the prolonged IbeA stimulation, which was correlated with the increased PSF relocalization or expression shown in  XREF_FIG ,  XREF_FIG ,  XREF_FIG  and  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY . E44-induced PSF relocalization was significantly reduced in HBMECs transfected with vimentin siRNA ( XREF_FIG ). Recruitment of PSF was also remarkably suppressed in HBMECs transduced with the vimentin head domain deletion construct upon stimulation with IbeA ( XREF_FIG ) and E44 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ). These results suggest that regulation of PSF by tyrosine kinases and vimentin may play a role in IbeA-induced NFkappaB activation and translocation.\n\n\n\nIbeA+ E. coli induced proteasomal degradation is inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of vimentin and VH domain deletion.\n\nOur previous study demonstrated that the proteasome-regulated NF-kappaB played an important role in IbeA/vimentin-induced expression of adhesion molecules and transmigration of PMNs across HBMECs. WFA (withafferin A), a dual inhibitor of vimentin  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR  and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , could block IbeA-induced upregulation of ICAM-1/CD44 and activation/translocation of NF-kappaB through a vimentin-dependent mechanism  XREF_BIBR . Vimentin has been implicated in the stabilization of the Scribble polarity protein by protecting it from proteasomal degradation  XREF_BIBR . In order to further examine the role of vimentin in the IbeA-induced proteasomal degradation, we examined the colocalization of vimentin and polyubiquitinylated proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY , the polyubiquitinylated proteins were clustered and colocalized with vimentin around the perinuclear region upon stimulation with the IbeA protein or IbeA+ E. coli (E44), but not in the untreated cells or the cells treated with ZD1. The polyubiquitinylated proteins also aggregated to small particles to colocalize with vimentin on the cell membranes (indicated by arrows), which were called aggresomes and play an important role in the proteasomal degradation  XREF_BIBR . These results suggest that vimentin might directly bind to polyubiquitinylated proteins to exert its protection and inhibit their degradation. The immunoblotting analysis of polyubiquitinylated proteins in HBMECs was consistent with the microscopy examination, which showed that more polyubiquitinylated proteins in HBMECs treated with the control siRNA were induced by IbeA+ E. coli K1 than ZD1 or the non-treated control (left panel in  XREF_FIG ). However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of vimentin resulted in stronger polyubiquitinylation than the control siRNA for each treatment, suggesting that vimentin could exert a protective role in proteasomal degradation ( XREF_FIG ). Since the VH domain has been demonstrated as the scaffold region for many signaling proteins, we therefore hypothesized that the VH domain might be required for its protection role in proteasomal degradation. To test this hypothesis, the GFP-VRT transductant with the VH domain deletion was used to examine the polyubiquitinylated proteins in HBMECs treated with E44 or ZD1. As shown in  XREF_FIG , the GFP-VRT transductant contained considerably more polyubiquitinylated proteins when compared to the GFP transductant. These results indicated that the vimentin head domain is essential for its protective role in proteasomal degradation. PDZ-containing proteins have been implicated in the regulation of NF-kappaB signaling  XREF_BIBR . Since Scribble, a PDZ protein, has been shown to be stabilized by vimentin, we examined whether Scribble contributed to IbeA+ E. coli-induced invasion and PMNs transmigration across HBMECs. Effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of vimentin and Scribble on IbeA-induced pathogenicities were investigated. As shown in  XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY , the knockdown of both proteins could equally suppress IbeA-mediated bacterial invasion and PMNs transmigration, but not in the cells treated with ZD1. These results implied that Scribble may contribute to IbeA-induced NF-kappaB signaling.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn this report, we show that NF-kappaB signaling induced by meningitic E. coli K1 requires two IbeA-binding proteins, the primary receptor vimentin and the co-receptor PSF. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the specific interaction between IbeA and its primary receptor vimentin is the upstream signaling event, which is required for the caveolae/lipid raft-dependent entry of E. coli K1 into HBMECs  XREF_BIBR . Subsequently, the co-receptor PSF and activated signaling molecules (e.g., ERK, caveolin-1) are recruited to the lipid raft microdomains. Furthermore, ERK, which is able to communicate a signal from a receptor on the cell surface to the DNA in the nucleus, was shown to be important for NF-kappaB activation in response to Ras activation  XREF_BIBR  or anthracycline drug treatment  XREF_BIBR . The current report shows that vimentin forms a complex with IkappaB, NF-kappaB and tubulins in the resting cells. A dissociation of this complex and a simultaneous association of PSF with NF-kappaB could be increased by IbeA in a time-dependent manner. IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation is completely abolished in HBMECs lacking vimentin and PSF. ERK activation is entirely dependent on PSF. These findings suggest that vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. PSF is essential for the translocation of NF-kappaB and ERK to the nucleus.\n\nThe major intermediate filament protein vimentin is an important marker of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition). The EMT phenotypes are usually associated with embryonic development and the malignant conversion of epithelial tumor cells  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR . The EMT phenotype in Ras-transformed epithelial cells is suppressed by inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling. Blockage of NF-kappaB is positively correlated with the suppression of vimentin expression and inhibition of the invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells, suggesting that EMT may be used as a predictor of certain cancers  XREF_BIBR . In concurrence with these findings, IbeA-mediated PMN transmigration can be enhanced by upregulation of vimentin through NF-kappaB activation  XREF_BIBR . Vimentin expression may be upregulated by activated NF-kappaB, which binds to a regulatory element (enhancer) in the promoter of the human vimentin-encoding gene  XREF_BIBR . Furthermore, the regulatory role of vimentin in NF-kappaB activation has been implicated in our recent studies on the effects of vimentin blockage on gene expression, which shows significant inhibition of NF-kappaB in the nuclei of HBMECs lacking vimentin  XREF_BIBR . Here, we have further demonstrated that vimentin could contribute to regulation of NF-kappaB by forming a complex with IkappaB, NF-kappaB and tubulins in the resting cells. This complex is dissociated upon the prolonged stimulation with IbeA. As reported by Georgatos et al. in 1985  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , oligomeric species of vimentin bind to human erythrocyte membranes through its head domain-mediated interactions with ankyrin. Since IkappaB proteins contain multiple ankyrin repeats  XREF_BIBR , it is most likely that the head domain of vimentin binds to the ankyrin domains of the IkappaB proteins. Our results have demonstrated for the first time that the vimentin head domain is essential for its interactions with IkappaB/NF-kappaB. It remains to be determined whether this binding requires phosphorylation or other modifications of vimentin. There are two different types of vimentin proteins, the insoluble (e.g., receptors) and the soluble (e.g., secreted), which contribute to bacterial pathogenesis. Vimentin on the surface of BMEC functions as the primary receptor for IbeA and plays an essential role in IbeA+ E. coli K1-induced NF-kappaB signaling, bacterial invasion and PMN migration across the BBB  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . However, the soluble vimentin, which can be modified and secreted by macrophages  XREF_BIBR  and EC  XREF_BIBR , may be involved in microbial infections in a manner similar to the soluble receptors. Their exact relationship with pathogen-induced signaling may warrant further studies. Microtubules may also interact with IkappaB proteins in the same way as vimentin because they bind to ankyrin domain-containing proteins  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . As shown in our previous studies, IbeA-induced NF-kappaB activation and translocation are abolished by the blockage of vimentin (whithaferin A) and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (PS-341)  XREF_BIBR . These blockages resulted in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the cytosol, suggesting the involvement of vimentin and UPS. The current studies show that IbeA-induced E. coli K1 invasion and PMN transmigration across HBMECs are significantly blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Scribble, a PDZ domain-containing protein regulated by vimentin  XREF_BIBR , suggesting that vimentin contributes to IbeA-induced activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in coordination with UPS and Scribble. The PDZ protein, DLIM2, has been recently identified as a novel regulator of NF-kappaB  XREF_BIBR . Defining the role of vimentin, UPS and Scribble in IbeA-induced signaling may add a new layer to the mechanics of NF-kappaB regulation.\n\nPSF exhibits multiple functions, including the binding of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins, DNA pairing, promotion of pre-mRNA splicing, and transcriptional regulation  XREF_BIBR . PSF has been shown to be one of the key factors mediating the posttranscriptional regulation of HIV-1 and causes a dose-dependent inhibition of virus production in cell culture  XREF_BIBR . It has been clearly established that PSF also contributes to the regulation of gene expression mediated by several nuclear hormones (e.g., thyroid hormone, progesterone, and androgens) receptors via different mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA binding, proteosomal receptor degradation, and/or recruitment of coactivators such as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex  XREF_BIBR . Transcriptional activity of several steroid receptors could be blocked by overexpression of PSF through direct protein-protein interactions with several transcriptional regulators  XREF_BIBR . Association of PSF with pERK was recently found to be highly regulated  XREF_BIBR . Insulin-like growth factor-I could dissociate the pERK-PSF complexes, which would then result in integration of many signaling events to allow dissociated pERK to access, phosphorylate, and activate Sp1, thereby driving steroidogenesis  XREF_BIBR . We have demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of PSF could completely abolish phosphorylation of ERK and IKK, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, suggesting that PSF association with pERK and pIKK may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the regulation of IbeA-induced NF-kappaB signaling. Recently, we demonstrated that p54nrb, a PSF protein partner, could contribute to IbeA+ E. coli-induced pathogenicities  XREF_BIBR . Due to their dual RNA/DNA-binding properties and the ability to interact with several protein counterparts, PSF and p54nrb might contribute to multiple gene regulation processes, which may play a crucial role in E. coli K1-induced activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Thus, it can be speculated that IbeA/vimentin/PSF interactions may represent an important mechanism responsible for a coordinated modulation of both bacterial and host factors that contribute to bacterial invasion and PMN transmigration. Further work is needed to examine how vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to IbeA-induced NF-kappaB signal transduction.\n\nIn this study we also show that functional microtubules are required for the nuclear transport of transcription factor NF-kappaB in HBMECs upon stimulation with IbeA. Several microtubule inhibitors (colchicine, vincristine, nocodazole) that can inhibit tubulin polymerization decreased IbeA-induced nuclear translocation of active NF-kappaB into the nucleus. Two of these inhibitors, colchicines and vincristine, could also block phosphorylation of ERK and IKK. It has been shown that two major cytoskeletal systems, actin filament and microtubule, are able to regulate the NF-kappaB system  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR . It has been well established that there are interactions or crosstalks between intermediate filaments and microtubules  XREF_BIBR . Their close association in several cell types is demonstrated by electron-microscopy studies. For example, these two kinds of cytoskeletons form closely associated parallel arrays throughout the cytoplasm of fibroblasts. A specific subset of stable, detyrosinated microtubules (Glu-MTs) are shown to be involved in these associations  XREF_BIBR . A crosstalk between intermediate filaments and microtubules is suggested in the current studies as beta-tubulin binds to the head domain of vimentin. Understanding the molecular basis of the crosstalk between vimentin intermediate filaments and microtubules may be essential for determining the mechanisms that underlie NF-kappaB activation.\n\nIn summary, the current studies with IbeA+ E. coli K1 infection in HBMECs show that vimentin and PSF play an important role in the pathogenesis of meningitic infection by contributing to modulation of the early and late events of NF-kappaB signaling in a coordinated manner. Cooperative contributions of vimentin and PSF to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB may represent a new paradigm in pathogen-induced signal transduction and lead to the development of novel strategies for prevention and treatment of bacterial meningitis.\n\n",
