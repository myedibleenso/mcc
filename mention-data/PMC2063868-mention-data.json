We recently reported that the semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor Plexin-B1 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for R-Ras, a member of Ras family GTPases implicated in regulation of integrin activity and cell migration (Oinuma, I., Y. Ishikawa, H. Katoh, and M. Negishi. 2004. Science. 305:862-865). We characterized the role of R-Ras downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 in cell migration. Activation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D suppressed the ECM-dependent R-Ras activation, R-Ras-mediated phosphatydylinositol 3-kinase activation, and beta 1  integrin activation through its R-Ras GAP domain, leading to inhibition of cell migration. In addition, inactivation of R-Ras by overexpression of the R-Ras-specific GAP or knockdown of R-Ras by RNA interference was sufficient for suppressing beta 1  integrin activation and cell migration in response to the ECM stimulation. Thus, we conclude that R-Ras activity is critical for ECM-mediated beta 1  integrin activation and cell migration and that inactivation of R-Ras by Sema4D/Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity controls cell migration by modulating the activity of beta 1  integrins.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nSemaphorins comprise a large family of secreted and transmembrane molecules that play central roles in axon guidance in the developing nervous system (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). The function of semaphorins is mediated by plexins, which are classified into four subfamilies: Plexin-A, -B, -C, and -D (XREF_BIBR). Semaphorins were originally identified as repulsive axonal guidance molecules, but they have recently been shown to regulate integrin-mediated cell migration in a variety of cells (XREF_BIBR). Sema3A exerts an essential permissive role in the execution of vasculature remodeling by inhibiting integrin-mediated adhesion of endothelial cells to the ECM (XREF_BIBR). Activation of Plexin-B1 negatively regulates integrin-based cell adhesion and migration of NIH-3T3 cells (XREF_BIBR). Plexin-C1 inhibits integrin-mediated adhesion and chemokine-induced migration of dendritic cells (XREF_BIBR). Thus, semaphorin/plexin signaling plays an important role in the migration of a variety of cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of integrin-mediated cell migration by semaphorins through plexins remain unclear.\n\nRho family small GTPases are signal transduction molecules that remodel the actin cytoskeleton and play fundamental roles in numerous cellular processes (XREF_BIBR). The small GTPase Rnd1, a constitutively active GTPase (XREF_BIBR), is known to interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 (XREF_BIBR). We recently revealed that Plexin-B1 functions as an R-Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and directly and specifically down-regulates R-Ras activity in response to Sema4D, inducing repulsive response in hippocampal neurons, and that the expression of R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 requires Rnd1 association with the receptor (XREF_BIBR). Furthermore, expression of constitutively active R-Ras prevents growth cone collapse induced by Sema4D/Plexin-B1 as well as Sema3A/Plexin-A1, whereas R-Ras siRNA caused a growth cone collapse similar to those induced by semaphorins (XREF_BIBR).\n\nIntegrins are a family of alpha/beta heterodimeric cell surface receptors that bind to the ECM, such as collagens and fibronectins, and play a central part in regulating cell growth, survival, migration, and tumor metastasis (XREF_BIBR). Activation of integrins is essential for cell adhesion and cell migration, and several studies show that the Ras family of small GTPases regulates integrin activity (XREF_BIBR). Among the Ras family GTPases, activated R-Ras was shown to induce integrin activation and increase cell adhesion and matrix assembly, suggesting that R-Ras plays an important role in the regulation of integrin activity (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, how R-Ras activity is regulated and how R-Ras activates integrins remain obscure. Significantly, Sema4D was the first extracellular stimulus shown to influence the activity of R-Ras. These facts collectively prompted us to speculate that plexins regulate integrin-mediated cell migration by their R-Ras GAP activity.\n\nIn this study, we characterized the role of R-Ras downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 in regulation of integrin activation and cell migration. The activation of R-Ras by ECM is required for ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration, and Sema4D/Plexin-B1 inhibits integrin activation and cell migration through R-Ras GAP activity. We also revealed that down-regulation of phosphatydylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity is responsible for Sema4D/Plexin-B1-induced suppression of beta 1  integrin activity and cell migration.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nSema4D antagonizes integrin-mediated cell migration.\n\nWe examined the effect of Sema4D on integrin-mediated migration of PC12 cells in a cell migration assay (XREF_FIG). Transwell chambers were coated on the lower side with varying concentrations of collagen I. PC12 cells exhibited a collagen concentration-dependent promotion of cell migration, which was antagonized by Sema4D. The collagen-dependent PC12 cell migration is mediated by alpha 1  and beta 1  integrin subunits, as functional blocking antibodies against alpha 1  (XREF_FIG) and beta 1  (XREF_FIG) integrin subunits strongly impaired the migration. These results indicate that Sema4D antagonizes the collagen receptor, alpha 1 /beta 1  integrin-dependent PC12 cell migration.\n\n\n\nSema4D through Plexin-B1 inhibits ECM-mediated activation of R-Ras and beta 1  integrins.\n\nR-Ras is implicated in integrin-mediated cell migration, and expression of a constitutively active form of R-Ras has been shown to stimulate cell migration (XREF_BIBR). We previously reported that Sema4D stimulation down-regulates NGF-stimulated R-Ras activity via the R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 to induce neurite retraction (XREF_BIBR). We next tested whether stimulation of PC12 cells with collagen and Sema4D affects R-Ras activity. PC12 cells were plated onto collagen-coated dishes and lysed, and the lysates were incubated with the GST-fused Ras binding domain of c-Raf-1 (GST-RBD) to pull down activated R-Ras (XREF_BIBR). As shown in XREF_FIG, cells plated on collagen-coated dishes showed a collagen concentration-dependent increase in endogenous R-Ras activity, whereas those kept in suspension or plated onto the non-integrin-dependent substrate poly-d-lysine did not. Furthermore, the collagen-dependent activation of R-Ras was inhibited by a functional blocking antibody against beta 1  integrins, P5D2, and was enhanced by affinity-related activation of beta 1  integrins by the monoclonal antibody 8A2, which mechanically induces a high-affinity state of beta 1  integrins. These data suggest that beta 1  integrins are required for R-Ras activation upon ECM-mediated adhesion. Sema4D stimulation strongly inhibited the collagen-induced activation of R-Ras, and affinity-related activation of beta 1  integrins by the 8A2 antibody attenuated the inhibitory effect of Sema4D on ECM-mediated R-Ras activation. R-Ras is known to regulate beta 1  integrin activation (XREF_BIBR). To examine the effect of Sema4D on beta 1  integrin activity, we measured the activity of beta 1  integrins in cells with or without Sema4D stimulation by the immunoprecipitation assay with the monoclonal antibody against active conformations of beta 1  integrins, HUTS-4, which detects hybrid domain swing-out in beta 1  integrins, a process most commonly associated with ligand binding (XREF_BIBR). Sema4D antagonized the collagen-dependent activation of beta 1  integrins (XREF_FIG). Inhibition of beta 1  integrin activity by Sema4D was also observed in the ELISA using the HUTS-4 antibody, which was performed under a detergent-free condition (XREF_FIG). To further ascertain that Sema4D indeed affects the activity of beta 1  integrins, we performed flow cytometry analysis using the HUTS-4 antibody. As shown in XREF_FIG, cells treated with Sema4D showed a decrease in the level of HUTS-4 binding (FITC staining). Mn 2+  treatment, which induces the activation of beta 1  integrins, resulting in the effective interaction with the ECM ligands and increased HUTS-4 binding (XREF_BIBR), completely overcame the Sema4D-induced decrease in HUTS-4 binding. These results suggest that decreased HUTS-4 binding induced by Sema4D is due to affinity modulation of beta 1  integrins. FAK is known to be autophosphorylated at tyrosine upon integrin activation (XREF_BIBR), and FAK phosphorylation downstream of beta 1  integrins is the important step for integrin-mediated cell migration (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).As shown in XREF_FIG, Sema4D inhibited the collagen-mediated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that Sema4D inhibits ECM-mediated activation of R-Ras and beta 1  integrins.\n\nWe also confirmed the involvement of the endogenous Plexin-B1 receptor in Sema4D-dependent inhibition of R-Ras activity and integrin functions. As shown in XREF_FIG, both Sema4D-dependent inhibition of collagen-mediated activation of R-Ras and cell migration were blocked by the monoclonal antibody against Plexin-B1, which recognizes the extracellular ligand binding region of the receptor. These results suggest that Sema4D through Plexin-B1 inhibits ECM-mediated activation of R-Ras, functional activation of beta 1  integrins, and inhibition of cell migration.\n\n\n\nInhibition of cell migration by Sema4D is mediated by suppression of beta 1  integrin activity.\n\nWe tested whether Sema4D-mediated inhibition of cell migration is mediated by suppression of beta 1  integrin activity. PC12 cells preincubated with 5 mug/ml beta 1  integrin activating monoclonal antibody (8A2) were subjected to the transwell assay. We tested the migration at relatively low concentrations of collagen (~3.0 mug/ml) because this antibody inhibits cell migration at high concentration of the ECM ligands by freezing beta 1  at a high-affinity state (XREF_BIBR). As shown in XREF_FIG, affinity-related activation of beta 1  integrins by 8A2 stimulation overcame the inhibitory effect of Sema4D on collagen-mediated cell migration, whereas a control IgG2a antibody did not. These results suggest that the inhibition of beta 1  integrin activity is required for the inhibition of cell migration by Sema4D.\n\n\n\nPlexin-B1 inhibits ECM-dependent activation of R-Ras and beta 1  integrins through its R-Ras GAP activity.\n\nWe recently reported that Plexin-B1 encodes R-Ras GAP within its cytoplasmic tail and that Plexin-B1 associated with the Rho family GTPase Rnd1 functions as a specific GAP toward R-Ras (XREF_BIBR). We examined whether Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity suppresses adhesion-dependent R-Ras activation. COS-7 cells expressing R-Ras-wild type (WT) were plated onto fibronectin-coated dishes or nonadherent control dishes and lysed, and the lysates were incubated with GST-RBD to pull down activated R-Ras. The same cell lysates were also used for the immunoprecipitation assay using HUTS-4 for measurement of the activity of beta 1  integrins. In COS-7 cells, fibronectin stimulation activated both R-Ras and beta 1  integrins (XREF_FIG). As shown in XREF_FIG, expression of Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1 inhibited the fibronectin-mediated R-Ras activation in the presence of Sema4D. However, this inhibitory effect was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA, a mutant lacking the ability to associate with Rnd1, or Plexin-B1-RA, a mutant lacking primary and secondary arginine residues required for the catalytic activity of GAP. These results suggest that Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity inhibits adhesion-dependent R-Ras activation. To examine the effect of Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity on beta 1  integrin activity, we measured the activity of beta 1  integrins in cells expressing Plexin-B1 and Rnd1 with or without Sema4D stimulation by the immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in XREF_FIG, expression of Plexin-B1 and Rnd1 strongly inhibited the fibronectin-mediated beta 1  integrin activation in the presence of Sema4D, whereas inhibition of beta 1  integrin activation was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA or Plexin-B1-RA. The same results were also obtained by the ELISA using the HUTS-4 antibody performed under a detergent-free condition (XREF_FIG). We also confirmed the results by flow cytometry analysis. COS-7 cells transiently cotransfected with GFP-Rnd1 and Plexin-B1 were treated with Sema4D, and GFP expression and HUTS-4 binding (phycoerythrin [PE] staining) were simultaneously analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. HUTS-4 binding (PE staining) was analyzed on a gated subset of cells positive for GFP expression to discriminate beta 1  integrin activity of transfected cells from that of untransfected cells. As shown in XREF_FIG, a Sema4D-dependent decrease in HUTS-4 binding was observed in Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1-expressing cells. However, cells coexpressing Rnd1 with Plexin-B1-RA or Plexin-B1-GGA, which lacks R-Ras GAP activity, did not show a Sema4D-dependent reduction in HUTS-4 binding. In addition, Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1 also inhibited the fibronectin-mediated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of FAK phosphorylation was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA or Plexin-B1-RA (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity inhibits adhesion-dependent activation of R-Ras and thereby inhibits functional activation of beta 1  integrins.\n\n\n\nR-Ras activity is required for the ECM-mediated activation of beta 1  integrins.\n\nWe next examined whether regulation of R-Ras activity plays key roles in the ECM-mediated activation of beta 1  integrins. As shown in XREF_FIG, in untransfected cells, activity of beta 1  integrins was increased upon adhesion to fibronectin. This activation was completely blocked by the down-regulation of endogenous R-Ras activity by the expression of the myristoylated GAP domain of p98-R-RasGAP (Myr-R-RasGAP), which exhibits a specific GAP activity toward R-Ras (XREF_BIBR). R-Ras is implicated in integrin regulation, and the constitutively active form of R-Ras has been shown to increase the affinity of beta 1  integrins for fibronectin (XREF_BIBR) and to stimulate cell migration (XREF_BIBR). Expression of R-Ras-QL actually induced remarkable activation of beta 1  integrins, and this was not further enhanced by fibronectin. We also tested whether R-Ras activity affects FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in XREF_FIG, expression of Myr-R-RasGAP completely blocked the fibronectin-induced FAK phosphorylation, whereas R-Ras-QL markedly stimulated FAK phosphorylation independent of fibronectin, indicating that endogenous R-Ras activity is also required for ECM-mediated FAK phosphorylation. We further confirmed requirement of R-Ras in the ECM-mediated functional activation of beta 1  integrins. We reduced expression of R-Ras in COS-7 cells by R-Ras-specific siRNA expression vector and examined the effect on the activation of beta 1  integrins and phosphorylation of FAK. As shown in XREF_FIG (C and D), expression of R-Ras siRNA effectively reduced endogenous R-Ras protein, and reduction in R-Ras protein blocked both the fibronectin-dependent activation of beta 1  integrins and phosphorylation of FAK. The ELISA using HUTS-4, under detergent-free conditions, also confirmed suppression of beta 1  integrin activation by inactivation of R-Ras by expression of Myr-R-RasGAP or knockdown of R-Ras by R-Ras RNA interference (XREF_FIG). We also confirmed these results by two-color flow cytometry. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with Myr- R-RasGAP or an R-Ras siRNA together with GFP were stained with HUTS-4, and HUTS-4 binding (PE staining) was analyzed on GFP-positive cells. As shown in XREF_FIG, the level of HUTS-4 binding was reduced in cells expressing Myr-R-RasGAP or R-Ras siRNA. These results demonstrate that activation of the endogenous R-Ras protein is essential for the ECM-mediated functional activation of beta 1  integrins.\n\n\n\nPlexin-B1 inhibits cell migration through R-Ras GAP activity.\n\nWe next examined the effect of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 signaling on integrin-mediated cell migration. COS-7 cells expressing a control GFP alone exhibited a fibronectin concentration-dependent promotion of cell migration, and ectopic expression of GFP- R-Ras-WT enhanced this fibronectin-dependent cell migration (XREF_FIG). Coexpression of Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1 with R-Ras-WT blocked the R-Ras-induced promotion of cell migration toward fibronectin, in the presence of Sema4D at the lower well (XREF_FIG). On the other hand, expression of Plexin-B1-RA, a mutant of Plexin-B1 that lacks R-Ras GAP activity, did not exhibit the Sema4D-dependent inhibition of cell migration toward fibronectin (XREF_FIG). Association of Rnd1 with Plexin-B1 is essential for the expression of R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 (XREF_FIG), and inhibition of cell migration was not observed in the cells without Rnd1 or in the cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA, a mutant of Plexin-B1 unable to interact with Rnd1 (XREF_FIG). The Plexin-B subfamily has been shown to activate RhoA via its COOH-terminal PDZ domain binding motif (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, Plexin-B1-DeltaC, a mutant of Plexin-B1 that lacks the PDZ domain binding motif but still has R-Ras GAP activity (XREF_BIBR), inhibited fibronectin-dependent cell migration in the presence of Sema4D (XREF_FIG). Cell migration mediated by constitutively active R-Ras, R-Ras-QL, was not suppressed by the Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1 complex (XREF_FIG). Expression levels of these constructs used in the assay were similar, as verified by immunoblot analysis (not depicted). Furthermore, R-Ras activity is essential for ECM-mediated cell migration, as both inactivation of R-Ras by expression of Myr-R-RasGAP or knockdown of R-Ras by R-Ras RNA interference almost completely suppressed the fibronectin-dependent cell migration (XREF_FIG).\n\nWe further confirmed that the R-Ras GAP activity exhibited by endogenous Plexin-B1 is required for Sema4D-mediated inhibition of ECM-mediated PC12 cell migration. We recently reported that the cytoplasmic region of Plexin-B1 by nature takes the intramolecularly tethered form and that disruption of the interaction between the NH 2 -terminal region (N-Cyt) and the COOH-terminal region (C-Cyt) within the cytoplasmic domain (XREF_FIG) by Rnd1 binding to N-Cyt is essential for exhibiting the R-Ras GAP activity. C-Cyt associates with N-Cyt-GGA, which has no ability to interact with Rnd1, and Rnd1 cannot disrupt this interaction (XREF_BIBR). As shown in XREF_FIG, overexpression of Plexin-B1-N-Cyt-GGA could effectively block the Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1 complex-mediated R-Ras GAP activity, suggesting that Plexin-B1- N-Cyt-GGA could be an effective tool to inhibit the R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 in a dominant-negative manner. Overexpression of Plexin-B1-N-Cyt-GGA in PC12 cells almost completely blocked the Sema4D-mediated inhibition of ECM-mediated cell migration (XREF_FIG).\n\nWe also examined the role of endogenous R-Ras protein in PC12 cell migration. Transfection of the R-Ras siRNA effectively reduced the expression of endogenous R-Ras protein in PC12 cells, whereas the control siRNA did not work                                                                                , and expression of R-Ras siRNA almost completely suppressed the collagen-dependent cell migration                   , suggesting that R-Ras is a prime regulator for integrin-mediated cell migration in PC12 cells. These results demonstrate that activation of endogenous R-Ras protein is essential for the ECM-mediated cell migration and that regulation of R-Ras activity through Sema4D/Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity plays a key role in ECM-mediated cell migration.\n\n\n\nSema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1 inhibits PI3-K activity through its R-Ras GAP activity.\n\nPI3-K is the predominant effector of R-Ras (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), and R-Ras-mediated cell migration is sensitive to pharmacological PI3-K inhibitors (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Expression of R-Ras-QL induces the ECM-independent functional activation of beta 1  integrins and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (XREF_FIG) and causes COS-7 cell migration in the absence of ECM ligands (XREF_FIG). The D64A mutation of R-Ras or the pharmacological PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the cell migration induced by R-Ras-QL (XREF_FIG). R-Ras-QL-64A, the effector loop mutant of R-Ras, impairs the ability of R-Ras to activate PI3-K (XREF_BIBR), and R-Ras-QL-mediated phosphorylation of the PI3-K effector Akt (PKB) was abolished by the D64A mutation (XREF_FIG). We further examined the involvement of PI3-K in R-Ras-QL-induced activation of beta 1  integrins and subsequent FAK phosphorylation. As shown in XREF_FIG, D64A mutation or LY294002 treatment markedly blocked both R-Ras-QL-induced activation of beta 1  integrins and phosphorylation of the downstream effector FAK. It has been reported that prominent PI3-K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt occurs in response to beta 1  integrin-mediated adhesion (XREF_BIBR). We examined the effect of Sema4D/Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity on PI3-K activity by measuring the phosphorylation of Akt. As shown in XREF_FIG, expression of Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1 inhibited the fibronectin-mediated Akt phosphorylation in the presence of Sema4D. However, this inhibition was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA or Plexin-B1-RA that had no ability to exhibit R-Ras GAP activity (XREF_FIG). These results suggest that PI3-K activity is necessary for R-Ras-mediated activation of beta 1  integrins and that Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1 inactivates PI3-K through down-regulation of R-Ras activity.\n\n\n\nDown-regulation of PI3-K activity is responsible for Sema4D/Plexin-B1-induced suppression of beta 1  integrin activity.\n\nTo clear out the role of PI3-K downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1, leading to suppression of beta 1  integrin activity, we transfected p110alpha-CAAX, a constitutively active form of PI3-K (XREF_BIBR), and tested the ability of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 to inhibit beta 1  integrin activation. In COS-7 cells, overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX by itself did not induce beta 1  integrin activation in the absence of fibronectin (XREF_FIG; XREF_BIBR). On the other hand, overexpression of the kinase-dead form of p110alpha blocked the fibronectin-dependent beta 1  integrin activation. These results suggest that PI3-K activity is necessary but that PI3-K activity by itself is not sufficient for inducing beta 1  integrin activation. We next examined whether the down-regulation of PI3-K activity downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 is necessary for inhibition of beta 1  integrin activity. As shown in XREF_FIG, overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX blocked Sema4D/Plexin-B1-dependent inactivation of beta 1  integrins. We also examined the ability of Sema4D to inhibit cell migration in cells expressing p110alpha-CAAX. As shown in XREF_FIG, overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX in PC12 cells almost completely blocked the Sema4D-mediated inhibition of cell migration. These results suggest that down-regulation of PI3-K activity, downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1, is responsible for suppression of beta 1  integrin activity and inhibition of the ECM-mediated cell migration.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nCell migration is a fundamental cellular process in many cell types, and semaphorins are known to act as a negative regulator for integrin-mediated cell migration. We show that the Sema4D receptor, Plexin-B1, down-regulates R-Ras activity and inhibits ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration through its R-Ras GAP activity.\n\nR-Ras is implicated in integrin regulation, and a constitutively active form of R-Ras has been shown to increase the affinity of integrins for fibronectin (XREF_BIBR) and to stimulate cell migration (XREF_BIBR). We have examined a role of R-Ras in ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration and showed that R-Ras is markedly activated by the ECM and that this activation is required for activation of beta 1  integrins and subsequent cell migration, as inactivation of R-Ras activity by expression of the GAP domain of p98-R-RasGAP or knockdown of R-Ras by R-Ras-specific siRNA markedly reduces ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration. Our results also revealed that beta 1  integrins are required for R-Ras activation upon ECM-mediated adhesion. This suggests a positive feedback during cell-substrate adhesion, implicating R-Ras activation and the consequent further strengthening of integrin-mediated functions. Therefore, R-Ras is a central regulator for ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration, and the regulation of R-Ras activity is critical for integrin-mediated cell migration.\n\nSemaphorins are implicated in migration of a variety of cells. Stimulation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D is reported to hamper integrin-based adhesion and cell migration in NIH-3T3 cells (XREF_BIBR). We have reported that Plexin-B1 encodes an R-Ras GAP in the cytoplasmic tail and that stimulation of the Plexin-B1-Rnd1 complex by Sema4D induces the R-Ras GAP activity and resultant repulsive response of neuronal growth cone (XREF_BIBR). We demonstrate here that Plexin-B1/Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity is also involved in Sema4D-induced inhibition of integrin activation and cell migration. Furthermore, the COOH-terminal PDZ domain binding motif of Plexin-B1 is dispensable for suppression of integrin activity and cell migration by Sema4D. In addition to Sema4D, class 3 semaphorins have been shown to control adhesion and migration of endothelial cells by inhibiting integrin function (XREF_BIBR), and Sema3A signaling-deficient mice have shown defective migration of neural crest cells (XREF_BIBR). Furthermore, Plexin-C1, a receptor of semaphorin A39R, was recently reported to inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion and chemokine-induced migration (XREF_BIBR). The R-Ras GAP-homologous domains are well conserved among plexin families, including Plexin-A and -C1. In addition, we recently reported that the down-regulation of R-Ras activity is also required for the Sema3A/Plexin-A-induced repulsive response in hippocampal neurons (XREF_BIBR). We speculate that the direct regulation of R-Ras activity by plexins is likely to be a mutual signaling pathway among plexin families and that this R-Ras GAP activity of plexin families may be a critical signaling system for semaphorin-regulated cell migration.\n\nSemaphorins were initially identified as repulsive factors for axon guidance, and many neurons use members of the integrin family of cell surface receptors for responses to neurite growth promoting factors, and integrin activation regulates neurite outgrowth (XREF_BIBR). Recently, expression of constitutively active R-Ras was shown to promote integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth of retinal neurons, suggesting that R-Ras activity plays an important role in integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth (XREF_BIBR). Therefore, it is proposed that the down-regulation of R-Ras activity by Plexin-B1 via R-Ras GAP activity suppresses R-Ras-mediated integrin activation and thereby induces growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite outgrowth. With respect to signaling of other repulsive factors, the ephrin-B1 receptor EphB2, another family of the repulsive factor receptor, was also reported to suppress integrin-mediated functions by inactivating R-Ras (XREF_BIBR), suggesting that repulsive guidance cues inhibit integrin-mediated functions by inactivating R-Ras in general and that R-Ras acts as a common regulator of integrin activation and cell migration (XREF_BIBR).\n\nWe also examined the downstream signaling of Sema4D/Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity leading to inactivation of beta 1  integrins and found that down-regulation of PI3-K activity is responsible for Sema4D/Plexin-B1-induced suppression of beta 1  integrin activity and cell migration. PI3-K activity is known to be required for R-Ras-mediated enhancement of cell migration (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). PI3-K has emerged as the predominant effector for R-Ras, and R-Ras is a more potent activator of PI3-K than other Ras family members (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). On the other hand, PI3-K activity has been shown to promote interaction between talin with the beta 1  integrin cytoplasmic tail, leading to the clustering and activation of integrins (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Integrin activation by mechanical stretch is also mediated by PI3-K and is followed by an increase in integrin binding to the extracellular matrix proteins (XREF_BIBR). Therefore, elevated PI3-K activity by activated R-Ras may trigger a sequence of events leading to clustering and activation of integrins, although overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX by itself is not sufficient for inducing beta 1  integrin activation (XREF_FIG; XREF_BIBR). We used the monoclonal antibody HUTS-4, which detects hybrid domain swing-out in beta 1  integrins, a process most commonly associated with ligand binding affinity (XREF_BIBR), to measure activity of beta 1  integrins and revealed that Sema4D/Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity suppresses affinity of beta 1  integrins through inactivation of PI3-K activity. Consistent with our results, a previous report demonstrated that an R-Ras-mediated increase in affinity of the beta 1  integrins is dependent on PI3-K activity by performing the ligand binding assay in mast cells (XREF_BIBR). On the other hand, XREF_BIBR have shown that PI3-K activity is not required for R-Ras-mediated integrin activation in CHO cells by using a ligand-mimetic antibody, PAC-1. Therefore, we speculate that this discrepancy may be due to the differences in ways to measure integrin activity or that R-Ras may regulate integrin activity via both PI3-K-dependent and -independent pathways, depending on the cell type.\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that R-Ras activity is required for ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration and that the Sema4D/Plexin-B1-Rnd1 complex regulates integrin activation and cell migration through the R-Ras GAP activity. However, a variety of molecules such as ErbB-2 and Met have been known to be involved in plexin signaling, inducing diverse physiological functions (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR). It was recently shown that Plexin-B1 enhances chemotaxis of endothelial cells through the activation of multiple intracellular tyrosine kinase cascades independent of the R-Ras GAP activity (XREF_BIBR). Regulation of R-Ras activity, tyrosine kinases, and other signaling mechanisms may participate in diverse actions of plexins. Further work will be required to delineate the precise mechanism of R-Ras-mediated integrin activation and its regulation by plexins for cell migration during physiological and pathological processes, including neural cell migration, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis.\n\n\n\n","sentences":[{"words":["Semaphorin","4D/Plexin-B","1","mediated","R-Ras","GAP","activity","inhibits","cell","migration","by","regulating","beta","1","integrin","activity","."],"startOffsets":[0,11,22,24,33,39,43,52,61,66,76,79,90,95,98,107,115],"endOffsets":[10,22,23,32,38,42,51,60,65,75,78,89,94,96,106,115,116],"tags":["NNP","NN","CD","VBN","JJ","NN","NN","VBZ","NN","NN","IN","VBG","NN","CD","NN","NN","."],"lemmas":["Semaphorin","4d/plexin-b","1","mediate","r-ras","gap","activity","inhibit","cell","migration","by","regulate","beta","1","integrin","activity","."],"entities":["B-Family","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","B-BioProcess","I-BioProcess","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":1,"destination":2,"relation":"num"},{"source":3,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":3,"destination":6,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":6,"destination":4,"relation":"amod"},{"source":6,"destination":5,"relation":"nn"},{"source":7,"destination":15,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":7,"destination":3,"relation":"dep"},{"source":7,"destination":9,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":7,"destination":10,"relation":"prep"},{"source":9,"destination":8,"relation":"nn"},{"source":10,"destination":11,"relation":"pcomp"},{"source":11,"destination":12,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":15,"destination":13,"relation":"num"},{"source":15,"destination":14,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[7]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":1,"destination":2,"relation":"num"},{"source":3,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":3,"destination":6,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":6,"destination":4,"relation":"amod"},{"source":6,"destination":5,"relation":"nn"},{"source":7,"destination":15,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":7,"destination":3,"relation":"dep"},{"source":7,"destination":9,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":7,"destination":11,"relation":"prepc_by"},{"source":9,"destination":8,"relation":"nn"},{"source":11,"destination":12,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":15,"destination":13,"relation":"num"},{"source":15,"destination":14,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[7]}}},{"words":["Plexins","are","cell","surface","receptors","for","semaphorins","and","regulate","cell","migration","in","many","cell","types","."],"startOffsets":[120,128,132,137,145,155,159,171,175,184,189,199,202,207,212,217],"endOffsets":[127,131,136,144,154,158,170,174,183,188,198,201,206,211,217,218],"tags":["NNS","VBP","NN","NN","NNS","IN","NNS","CC","VB","NN","NN","IN","JJ","NN","NNS","."],"lemmas":["plexin","be","cell","surface","receptor","for","semaphorin","and","regulate","cell","migration","in","many","cell","type","."],"entities":["O","O","B-Cellular_component","I-Cellular_component","O","O","O","O","O","B-BioProcess","I-BioProcess","O","O","O","O","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","O","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":4,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":4,"destination":1,"relation":"cop"},{"source":4,"destination":2,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":5,"relation":"prep"},{"source":4,"destination":7,"relation":"cc"},{"source":4,"destination":8,"relation":"conj"},{"source":5,"destination":6,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":8,"destination":10,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":8,"destination":11,"relation":"prep"},{"source":10,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"},{"source":11,"destination":14,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":14,"destination":12,"relation":"amod"},{"source":14,"destination":13,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[4]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":4,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":4,"destination":1,"relation":"cop"},{"source":4,"destination":2,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":6,"relation":"prep_for"},{"source":4,"destination":8,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":8,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":8,"destination":10,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":8,"destination":14,"relation":"prep_in"},{"source":10,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"},{"source":14,"destination":12,"relation":"amod"},{"source":14,"destination":13,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[4]}}},{"words":["We","recently","reported","that","the","semaphorin","4D","(","Sema4D",")","receptor","Plexin-B1","functions","as","a","GTPase","activating","protein","(","GAP",")","for","R-Ras",",","a","member","of","Ras","family","GTPases","implicated","in","regulation","of","integrin","activity","and","cell","migration","(","Oinuma",",","I.",",","Y.","Ishikawa",",","H.","Katoh",",","and","M.","Negishi","."],"startOffsets":[219,222,231,240,245,249,260,263,264,270,272,281,291,301,304,306,313,324,332,333,336,338,342,347,349,351,358,361,365,372,38
