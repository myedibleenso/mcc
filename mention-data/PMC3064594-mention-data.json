EGFR\n                    monoclonal antibodies have been shown to increase the median survival and are\n                    approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Histone deacetylases (HDACs),\n                    frequently overexpressed in colorectal cancer and several malignancies, are\n                    another attractive targets for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of HDACs\n                    (HDACi) are developed and exhibit powerful antitumor abilities. In this study,\n                    human colorectal cancer cells treated with HDACi exhibited reduced EGFR\n                    expression, thereby disturbed EGF-induced ERK and Akt phosphorylation. HDACi\n                    also decreased the expression of SGLT1, an active glucose transporter found to\n                    be stabilized by EGFR, and suppressed the glucose uptake of cancer cells. HDACi\n                    suppressed the transcription of EGFR and class I HDACs were proved to be\n                    involved in this event. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that HDACi\n                    caused the dissociation of SP1, HDAC3 and CBP from EGFR promoter. Our data\n                    suggested that HDACi could serve as a single agent to block both EGFR and HDAC,\n                    and may bring more benefits to the development of CRC therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nEGFR (also known as ErbB-1/HER1), which belongs to the ErbB family of receptor\n                tyrosine kinases, comprises an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single\n                hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase-containing domain\n                    XREF_BIBR. Ligand\n                binding induces homo- or hetero-dimerization of receptor and subsequent activation\n                of the pathways including Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PDK1/Akt XREF_BIBR. Most of colorectal cancer\n                (CRC) is characterized with overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor\n                (EGFR) and predicted with high risk of metastasis and recurrence XREF_BIBR. Targeting\n                EGFR seems to be a promising approach for the CRC treatment. Indeed, cetuximab, a\n                human-mouse chimeric IgG1 antibody binds to the external domain of the EGFR, has\n                been approved by FDA in 2004 for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer XREF_BIBR. After that, a\n                fully humanized antibody, panitumumab, is also approved to treat CRC XREF_BIBR. However,\n                accumulating evidences demonstrate that the effects of targeting EGFR in colorectal\n                cancer are largely limited due to the status of KRAS mutation XREF_BIBR. The KRAS mutants bypass EGFR\n                to activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signals, and significantly weaken the therapeutic\n                effect of cetuximab XREF_BIBR. Examination of KRAS status is now a prerequisite for the\n                use of cetuximab XREF_BIBR. Although ~60% of CRC patients expressed\n                wild-type KRAS but only half of them benefits from cetuximab. Therefore, the KRAS\n                status is not the only determinant for the efficacy of EGFR target therapy XREF_BIBR. Therefore,\n                treatment with a broad spectrum of genetic backgrounds is urgently needed and would\n                benefit most patients irresponsive to cetuximab-based therapies.\n\nAlthough EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase and delivers signals after ligand\n                conjugation, its prosurvival effect can be independent to kinase activity. For\n                example, mice lacking EGFR are embryonic lethal but those harboring kinase-inactive\n                mutants only exhibit some epithelial defects XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. In addition, loss of EGFR\n                kinase activity decelerates cell proliferaiton but loss of its expression ruins the\n                glucose uptake and leads to cell death XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. Therefore, inhibition of EGFR\n                expression may be a better strategy for CRC therapy.\n\nHistone deacetylases (HDACs) which removes the acetyl groups from histone to silence\n                the gene transcription are highly expressed in various tumors XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. HDACs have become one of the\n                emerging targets for cancer therapy, and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) show promising\n                anticancer activities XREF_BIBR. Among various HDACi, SAHA (Vorinostat) had been\n                successfully approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). HDAC\n                family can be subdivided into four classes and the class I HDACs, which includes\n                HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8, have been reported to be highly expressed in colon\n                cancer XREF_BIBR.\n                The pro-proliferative effects of HDACs are connected to the transcriptional\n                repression of cdk-inhibitor, p21, and knockdown of HDAC 1, 2 and 3 reduced the\n                growth of several colon cancer cells XREF_BIBR. Therefore, HDAC may serve as a\n                potential target for CRC therapy, and SAHA had entered clinical trials for the\n                treatment of CRC XREF_BIBR.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated that the EGF signaling in KRAS mutant cell lines,\n                HCT116 and SW480, was disrupted by HDACi through transcriptional repression of EGFR\n                expression, indicating that HDACi served as a single agent to block EGFR and HDAC\n                simultaneously. Loss of EGFR partially contributed to the cytotoxic effect of HDAC\n                inhibitors. In addition, the expression of SGLT1, an active glucose transporter\n                which is stabilized by EGFR, was also decreased by HDACi and led to the reduction of\n                glucose uptake in colon cancer cells. The mechanism underlying the transcriptional\n                repression of EGFR by HDACi was involved with the histones hypoacetylation and the\n                dissociation of SP1, HDAC3 and CBP from EGFR promoter. Our data suggested that HDACi\n                could serve as a single agent to concurrently block both EGFR and HDAC, and may\n                bring benefits to the CRC patients with a broader range of genetic backgrounds.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nHDAC inhibitors disrupt the EGF signaling via silencing EGF receptor (EGFR)\n                    expression.\n\nTo examine the antitumor effect of HDACi in colorectal cancer, KRAS wild type\n                    (WiDR and HT29) and KRAS mutant cells (HCT116 and SW480) were treated with SAHA\n                    or cetuximab for 48 hours, and cell viability was measured. SAHA reduced the\n                    survival of these cells in a dose-dependent manner (XREF_FIG), suggesting the independence of the\n                    KRAS status on the antitumor activity of HDACi. In contrast, cetuximab had\n                    little effect on the cell viability (XREF_FIG). This result is consistent with the\n                    previous study that colorectal cancer cells treated with cetuximab were killed\n                    more efficiently by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) which is\n                    absent in in vitro system XREF_BIBR. Since EGFR plays a\n                    significant role in CRC, the ability of its ligand to trigger the downstream\n                    signal in KRAS mutant cells was examined. EGF triggered both Akt and ERK\n                    phosphorylation in HCT116 cells and induced ERK activation in SW480 cells (XREF_FIG), indicating that KRAS\n                    mutation doesn't fully take over the ligand-mediated ERK activation and\n                    also impling the significance of EGFR in KRAS mutant cells. Moreover,\n                    pretreatment with HDAC inhibitors, TSA and SAHA, disrupted the EGF-stimulated\n                    ERK and Akt phosphorylation in HCT116 cells and ERK phosphorylation in SW480\n                    cells (XREF_FIG). Since HDAC\n                    inhibitors blocked both Akt and ERK phosphorylations, the very proximal\n                    component of EGF signaling might be targeted by HDACi. Therefore, the expression\n                    of EGF receptor was firstly examined. After treatment with TSA, the expression\n                    of EGFR was decreased in HCT116, SW480, and HT29 cells. To identify whether this\n                    is a common phenomenon, cells originated from different organs were used. After\n                    treatment with TSA, the reduced EGFR expression was also seen in human skin\n                    (A431) and breast (MDA-MB468) cancer cells (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nHDAC inhibitors reduce the expression of SGLT1 and decrease the intracellular\n                    glucose.\n\nIn addition to EGF signaling, EGFR has been reported to be involved in the\n                    glucose transport by associating and stabilizing the active glucose transporter,\n                    SGLT1 XREF_BIBR,\n                        XREF_BIBR.\n                    Since the expression of EGFR was reduced by HDACi in CRC cells, the levels of\n                    SGLT1 expression and intracellular glucose in response to HDACi were also\n                    examined. As expected, TSA reduced the SGLT1 expression (XREF_FIG) and the intracellular glucose\n                    concentration (XREF_FIG).\n                    Glucose replenishment retained the intracellular glucose (XREF_FIG) and rescued cells from the\n                    TSA-induced cell death (XREF_FIG). These data suggested that the loss of EGFR and its partner,\n                    SGLT1, might be involved in the cytotoxic effect of HDAC inhibitors.\n\n\n\nLoss of EGFR is implicated in HDAC inhibitor-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\nHDAC inhibitors are shown to exert antitumor activity by arresting the cell cycle\n                    and triggering apoptosis XREF_BIBR. Consistently, SAHA increased sub-G1 population from\n                    7.72% to 17.23% and G2/M population from 16.6% to\n                    24.4% (XREF_FIG). To\n                    elucidate the role of EGFR in the antitumor activity of HDACi, cells were\n                    transfected with myc-EGFR and then treated with SAHA for 24 hrs. Overexpression\n                    of myc-tagged EGFR decreased the sub-G1 population and G2/M population (XREF_FIG). SAHA-induced p21\n                    expression was also attenuated by the ectopic expression of EGFR (XREF_FIG). These data indicated\n                    that SAHA-reduced EGFR expression contributed to the SAHA-induced apoptosis and\n                    cell cycle arrest.\n\n\n\nHDACs are implicated in the transcription of EGFR.\n\nSince the amount of EGFR protein is reduced after treatment with HDACi, the EGFR\n                    gene transcription was examined. The mRNA level of EGFR was decreased\n                    dramatically after treatment with TSA and SAHA (XREF_FIG), suggesting HDACi transcriptionally\n                    downregulate EGFR expression. This effect was further confirmed by EGFR reporter\n                    assays. Our result showed that TSA and SAHA significantly decreased the EGFR\n                    promoter activity (XREF_FIG\n                    upper panel). It has been reported that HDACi decreased the EGFR mRNA stability\n                    in ER-negative human breast cancer cells XREF_BIBR. Therefore, the stability of\n                    EGFR mRNA was examined. The de novo transcription was stopped\n                    by actinomycin D and the EGFR mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. The slope of\n                    EGFR mRNA degradation didn't show a significant difference between basal\n                    and TSA treatment (XREF_FIG\n                    lower panel), suggesting that HDACi didn't affect the degradation of EGFR\n                    mRNA in colorectal cancer cells. To further elucidate the involvement of HDACs\n                    in the transcription of EGFR, myc-tagged HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC3 was ectopically\n                    expressed in HCT116 cells, and EGFR mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. An increase of\n                    EGFR mRNA was found in all these HDAC-expressing cells (XREF_FIG upper panel). Conversely, knockdown\n                    of HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC3 by shRNA reduced the expression of EGFR protein (XREF_FIG lower panel). These\n                    data indicated that class I HDACs are crucial for EGFR expression. The positive\n                    correlation between EGFR and HDAC3 expression was also observed in fourteen\n                    pairs of human colon tumor and adjacent normal tissues (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nSP1 is essential for EGFR transcription and HDAC inhibitor disturbs the\n                    binding of SP1 to EGFR promoter.\n\nThere are several SP1 binding sites on the EGFR promoters and our previous\n                    studies showed that HDACi affects the binding of SP1 to ADAMTS1or p21 promoters\n                        XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Therefore,\n                    SP1 may participate in the HDACs-mediated EGFR expression. Indeed, inhibition of\n                    SP1 by mithramycin A (MTM) and siRNA significantly decreased the EGFR expression\n                        (XREF_FIG). Furthermore,\n                    MTM drastically reduced the EGFR promoter activity (XREF_FIG), indicating the critical role of SP1\n                    in EGFR gene transcription. The binding of SP1 to the EGFR promoter is further\n                    examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Five primer pairs (A, B, C, D\n                    and E) were designed to evenly cover the regions (-1,200 to +1,000\n                    bps) around transcription start site (XREF_FIG). Our data showed that the binding of\n                    SP1 to regions C and D was significantly decreased after treatment with SAHA\n                        (XREF_FIG). Furthermore,\n                    the acetylation of Histone H3 and H4 on EGFR promoter was largely reduced,\n                    especially in the regions nearby transcription start site (XREF_FIG). The status of histone methylation\n                    such as H3K4Me2, H3K9Me3 and H3K27Me3 was also examined. SAHA didn't\n                    change the residence of these methylation markers on EGFR promoter despite of\n                    enriched H3K4Me2 was found (XREF_FIG and data not shown). Since the acetylation of histone H3 and\n                    H4 dropped dramatically after HDAC inhibition, the occupancy of histone\n                    acetyltransferase (HAT) or HDAC on EGFR promoter was examined. Our result showed\n                    that the recruitment of CBP to region D was significantly decreased by SAHA\n                        (XREF_FIG). Interestingly,\n                    the binding of HDAC3 to the region D was attenuated, too (XREF_FIG). These data showed the dissociation\n                    of SP1, CBP and HDAC3 from EGFR promoter at the same time (XREF_FIG), implying that these proteins may\n                    influence each other and affect their binding to the EGFR promoter.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nEGFR and HDAC have been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal and various\n                cancers XREF_BIBR,\n                    XREF_BIBR. However,\n                their relationship is not well-characterized. In this study, we showed that HDAC\n                inhibitors (HDACi) were able to disrupt the EGF-signaling in colon cancer cells.\n                EGFR expression in these cells as well as other origins such as epidermoid (A431)\n                and breast (MDA-MB468) was decreased by HDACi, suggesting the potential of HDACi to\n                treat EGFR overexpressing cancers. HDACi also reduced the expression of an active\n                glucose transporter, SGLT1, and thereby suppressed the glucose uptake of colon\n                cancer cells. More in-depth, we showed that SAHA induced the dissociation of\n                SP1/CBP/HDAC3 from the regions around EGFR transcription start site where the\n                histones became hypoacetylated. Our data indicated that the HDAC inhibitors could\n                serve as a single agent to block EGFR and HDAC, two critical factors in CRC cells,\n                and may provide a more effective therapy for a broader range of indication.\n\nMost solid tumors reside in a hypoxic environment and prefer the anaerobic glycolysis\n                rather than aerobic glycolysis, converting glucose to lactate and produce fewer ATP\n                with less oxygen consumption. Therefore, the glucose uptake is frequently enhanced\n                in tumors by overexpression of glucose transporters, such as GLUT1 and SGLT1 XREF_BIBR. Unlike\n                GLUT1 that transports glucose passively, SGLT1 uses the electro-chemical sodium\n                gradient to transport glucose against the internal concentration gradient. SGLT1 is\n                expressed in human colon cancers, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and neoplastic\n                lesions of head and neck XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. It is found to be stabilized by EGFR, and knockdown of\n                EGFR decreases the SGLT1 expression and glucose uptake XREF_BIBR. Our data also showed that\n                HDACi-mediated loss of EGFR, and the concurrent reduction of SGLT1 expression and\n                glucose uptake would eliminate the overall pro-survival functions of EGFR.\n\nSeveral studies show the inhibitory effect of HDACi on EGFR expression in human\n                cancers. For example, FK-228, a depsipeptide HDAC inhibitor, is reported to decrease\n                the expression of EGFR in lung cancer cells XREF_BIBR. SAHA decreases the levels of EGFR\n                in ER-negative breast cancer cells via mRNA destabilzaiton XREF_BIBR. More recently, inhibition of\n                HDAC6 is found to enhance the endocytosis of EGFR through increasing tubulin\n                acetylation XREF_BIBR,\n                    XREF_BIBR. In this\n                study, we demonstrated that both EGFR mRNA and its promoter activity were inhibited\n                by HDAC inhibitors in colon cancer cells, indicating that the de\n                    novo synthesis of EGFR was transcriptionally inhibited. EGFR promoter\n                is characterized with GC-rich, and TATA-less, and harbors multiple specificity\n                protein 1 (Sp1) binding sites XREF_BIBR. In addition to SP1, several transcription factors, such\n                as AP-1, p53 and c-Jun, also participate in the EGFR transcription XREF_BIBR. SP1 has been\n                reported to regulate the basal EGFR promoter activity XREF_BIBR. We showed that inhibition or\n                knockdown of SP1 could decrease the promoter activity and protein expression of\n                EGFR, emphasizing its crucial role in EGFR expression.\n\nSP1 has been reported to be regulated by several post-translational modifications,\n                including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation XREF_BIBR. It is acetylated\n                by p300 and deacetylated by HDAC XREF_BIBR. Although acetylated SP1 could increase the transcription\n                of GC-box-dependent genes XREF_BIBR, accumulating data also show that acetylation of SP1\n                decrease the its transcriptional activity. For example, SP1 acetylation by HDACi\n                reduces its ability to regulate 12(s)-lipooxygenase (12S-LOX) expression. Ectopic\n                expression of SP1 mutant, which cannot be acetylated at lysine 703, increases\n                12S-LOX transcription, and deacetylation of SP1 is also required for the\n                transcription of COX-2 XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Our previous studies show that HDACi affects the binding\n                of SP1 to ADAMTS1 promoter and the association of SP1 and CBP on p21 promoter XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. SP1 on EGFR\n                promoter might be affected by HDACi as well. Indeed, SP1 was dissociated from EGFR\n                promoter after treatment with HDACi, implying that acetylation may decrease the\n                binding of SP1 to the EGFR promoter. Surprisingly, the histones on EGFR promoter\n                became hypoacetylated. This could be explained by the concurrent dissociation of\n                CBP, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT).\n\nHDACi is reported to induce G2/M growth arrest as well as G0/G1 arrest in colorectal\n                cancer cells, and the HDACi-mediated growth arrest consistently involves p21\n                induction XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. In HCT116 cells, p21 is induced and the cell cycle is\n                arrested in G2/M phase by silencing class I HDACs, especially HDAC3 XREF_BIBR. Consistently,\n                we found that SAHA induced p21 and G2/M arrest and re-expression of EGFR could\n                alleviate these events. HDAC3 has been reported to be maximally expressed in the\n                proliferative compartment in mouse colon. Knockdown of HDAC3 induced a greater\n                magnitude of G2/M and S phase arrest than that of HDAC1/2, suggesting that HDAC3 is\n                more significant than HDAC1/2 in colon cell proliferation XREF_BIBR. HDAC3 is a component of the\n                NCoR-SMRT co-repressor complex, which is distinct from repressor complexes\n                containing HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Sin3A and NuRD) XREF_BIBR, indicating the specific roles\n                of HDAC isoform in gene repressing. In contrast, knockdown of HDAC1, 2 or 3\n                decreased the EGFR expression in varying degree, indicating that they share\n                functional redundancy on promoting EGFR transcription. Ectopic express HDAC3 induced\n                a greater magnitude of EGFR mRNA and a positive correlation between EGFR and HDAC3\n                expression in colon cancer patients. Therefore, HDAC3 may be most essential in EGFR\n                transcription.\n\nAssociation of HDACs with gene promoters are traditionally considered to repress\n                transcription and HDAC is thought to reactivate the silenced genes XREF_BIBR. However, HDACi\n                is also reported to decrease the expression of thymidylate synthase, vascular\n                endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and\n                endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR. It is suggested that gene\n                transcription primed by H3K4 methylation requires the dynamic cycle of histone\n                acetylation and deacetylation by transient HAT/HDAC binding XREF_BIBR. In this study, we found that\n                EGFR promoter was enriched with H3K4 di-methylation, suggesting that EGFR gene\n                transcription may be primed by H3K4 methylation. HDAC3 and CBP were both associated\n                with EGFR promoter and concurrently dissociated after treatment with HDACi, implying\n                that dynamic HAT/HDAC binding is occurred. Since CBP and HDAC3 are unable to\n                directly bind gene promoter, SP1 may serve as a bridge between CBP/HDAC3 and EGFR\n                promoter (XREF_FIG). HDACi may\n                induce SP1 acetylation and leads to its dissociation from EGFR promoter, which\n                disrupts the dynamic binding of HDAC3 and CBP (XREF_FIG). Taken together, our results showed that\n                the SP1, HDAC3 and CBP were all dissociated from EGFR promoter after SAHA treatment,\n                suggesting their functional relevance on EGFR transcription.\n\nIt has been reported that HDAC inhibitors synergize with 5-FU in\n                    vitro and in vivo to treat colon cancer through\n                downregulation of thymidylate synthase, the 5-FU target enzyme XREF_BIBR. Combination of 5-FU with SAHA\n                has recently entered phase I/II trial to treat CRC XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Inhibition of MAPK and Akt\n                signaling by AEE788, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinases inhibitor, synergistically\n                potentiates HDAC-induced apoptosis in a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines XREF_BIBR. Recently, a new\n                compound, CUDC-101, which inhibit the activity of both EGFR and HDAC, is\n                demonstrated to have powerful anticancer activity XREF_BIBR. These reports strengthen the\n                rationale of concurrent inhibition of EGFR and HDAC in cancer therapy. In this\n                study, we showed that HDAC inhibitor alone is able to block EGFR transcription as\n                well as HDAC, and may provide a hint for superior strategy of colorectal cancer\n                therapy.\n\n","sentences":[{"words":["HDAC","Inhibition","Decreases","the","Expression","of","EGFR","in","Colorectal","Cancer","Cells","."],"startOffsets":[0,5,16,26,30,41,44,49,52,63,90,95],"endOffsets":[4,15,25,29,40,43,48,51,62,69,95,96],"tags":["NN","NN","VBZ","DT","NN","IN","NN","IN","JJ","NN","NNS","."],"lemmas":["hdac","inhibition","decrease","the","expression","of","egfr","in","colorectal","cancer","cell","."],"entities":["B-Family","O","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-TissueType","I-TissueType","O","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":2,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":2,"destination":4,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"det"},{"source":4,"destination":5,"relation":"prep"},{"source":5,"destination":6,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":6,"destination":7,"relation":"prep"},{"source":7,"destination":10,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":10,"destination":8,"relation":"amod"},{"source":10,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[2]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":2,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":2,"destination":4,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"det"},{"source":4,"destination":6,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":6,"destination":10,"relation":"prep_in"},{"source":10,"destination":8,"relation":"amod"},{"source":10,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[2]}}},{"words":["Epidermal","growth","factor","receptor","(","EGFR",")",",","a","receptor","tyrosine","kinase","which","promotes","cell","proliferation","and","survival",",","is","abnormally","overexpressed","in","numerous","tumors","of","epithelial","origin",",","including","colorectal","cancer","(","CRC",")","."],"startOffsets":[100,110,117,124,133,134,138,139,141,143,152,161,168,194,203,208,222,226,234,236,239,250,264,287,296,303,306,317,323,325,335,346,353,354,357,358],"endOffsets":[109,116,123,132,134,138,139,140,142,151,160,167,173,202,207,221,225,234,235,238,249,263,266,295,302,305,316,323,324,334,345,352,354,357,358,359],"tags":["JJ","NN","NN","NN","-LRB-","NN","-RRB-",",","DT","NN","NN","NN","WDT","VBZ","NN","NN","CC","NN",",","VBZ","RB","VBN","IN","JJ","NNS","IN","JJ","NN",",","VBG","JJ","NN","-LRB-","NN","-RRB-","."],"lemmas":["epidermal","growth","factor","receptor","(","egfr",")",",","a","receptor","tyrosine","kinase","which","promote","cell","proliferation","and","survival",",","be","abnormally","overexpress","in","numerous","tumor","of","epithelial","origin",",","include","colorectal","cancer","(","crc",")","."],"entities":["B-Gene_or_gene_product","I-Gene_or_gene_product","I-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","B-Site","O","O","O","B-BioProcess","I-BioProcess","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","B-TissueType","I-TissueType","O","O","O","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-NP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O","B-VP","I-VP","I-VP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","O","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":3,"destination":0,"relation":"amod"},{"source":3,"destination":1,"relation":"nn"},{"source":3,"destination":2,"relation":"nn"},{"source":3,"destination":5,"relation":"appos"},{"source":3,"destination":11,"relation":"appos"},{"source":11,"destination":8,"relation":"det"},{"source":11,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"},{"source":11,"destination":10,"relation":"nn"},{"source":11,"destination":13,"relation":"rcmod"},{"source":13,"destination":15,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":13,"destination":12,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":15,"destination":16,"relation":"cc"},{"source":15,"destination":17,"relation":"conj"},{"source":15,"destination":14,"relation":"nn"},{"source":21,"destination":3,"relation":"nsubjpass"},{"source":21,"destination":19,"relation":"auxpass"},{"source":21,"destination":20,"relation":"advmod"},{"source":21,"destination":22,"relation":"prep"},{"source":22,"destination":24,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":24,"destination":23,"relation":"amod"},{"source":24,"destination":25,"relation":"prep"},{"source":24,"destination":29,"relation":"prep"},{"source":25,"destination":27,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":27,"destination":26,"relation":"amod"},{"source":29,"destination":31,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":31,"destination":33,"relation":"appos"},{"source":31,"destination":30,"relation":"amod"}],"roots":[21]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":31,"destination":33,"relation":"appos"},{"source":31,"destination":30,"relation":"amod"},{"source":3,"destination":0,"relation":"amod"},{"source":3,"destination":1,"relation":"nn"},{"source":3,"destination":2,"relation":"nn"},{"source":3,"destination":5,"relation":"appos"},{"source":3,"destination":11,"relation":"appos"},{"source":11,"dest
