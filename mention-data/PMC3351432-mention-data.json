To elucidate the mechanism by which Shoc2 regulates ERK1/2 activation by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), we studied subcellular localization of Shoc2. Upon EGFR activation, endogenous Shoc2 and red fluorescent protein tagged Shoc2 were translocated from the cytosol to a subset of late endosomes containing Rab7. The endosomal recruitment of Shoc2 was blocked by overexpression of a GDP-bound H-RAS (N17S) mutant and RNAi knockdown of clathrin, suggesting the requirement of RAS activity and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. RNAi depletion of Shoc2 strongly inhibited activation of ERK1/2 by low, physiological EGF concentrations, which was rescued by expression of wild-type recombinant Shoc2. In contrast, the Shoc2 (S2G) mutant, that is myristoylated and found in patients with the Noonan-like syndrome, did not rescue ERK1/2 activation in Shoc2-depleted cells. Shoc2 (S2G) was not located in late endosomes but was present on the plasma membrane and early endosomes. These data suggest that targeting of Shoc2 to late endosomes may facilitate EGFR-induced ERK activation under physiological conditions of cell stimulation by EGF, and therefore, may be involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling through the RAS-RAF module.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nOrganization of signaling modules in macromolecular complexes by scaffold proteins has an important role in regulating intracellular signaling in time and space and defining its input/output strength XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Scaffold proteins tether signaling components and localize them to specific areas of the cell, providing microenvironments where the concentration of interacting partners is greatly increased XREF_BIBR. In addition, scaffolds regulate signal transduction by coordinating positive and negative feedback signals, and by shielding correct signaling proteins from irrelevant stimuli XREF_BIBR.\n\nThe signaling cascade leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (MAPK/ERK1/2) is an intricate system that is regulated at multiple cellular sites XREF_BIBR. The ERK1/2 activation cascade is initiated by various extracellular stimuli leading to GTP loading of RAS, recruitment of the RAF kinase to GTP-RAS, phosphorylation and activation of the MAPK kinase (MEK1 and 2) by RAF, and finally activating phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK1/2 XREF_BIBR. The outcome of ERK1/2 activation ultimately depends on the set of substrates that ERK1/2 phosphorylates at specific cellular locations. In many instances, this complex pathway is regulated by a number of accessory proteins and, in particular, scaffold proteins XREF_BIBR. Scaffolds bind the components of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade, bring them together and target multi-protein signaling modules to different cellular locations, thus enhancing phosphorylation of specific substrates XREF_BIBR. Overexpression of scaffold proteins often results in the sequestration of their interaction partners to non-specific complexes, which disturbs the ERK activation process and its regulation XREF_BIBR.\n\nSeveral scaffold proteins have been shown to localize components of the ERK1/2 cascade to specific cellular locations. Kinase suppressor of RAS (KSR) is the best-studied scaffold of the ERK1/2 pathway that is conserved from C. elegans to humans XREF_BIBR. KSR forms multi-component complexes at the plasma membrane, bringing together RAF, MEK and ERK XREF_BIBR. MEK Partner 1 (MP-1) was identified originally as a MEK1 binding protein and later was reported to have scaffolding properties XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. MP-1 interacts specifically with MEK1 and ERK1, enhances their interaction and recruits these complexes to late endosomes. MP-1 complex is anchored to the endosomal membrane by means of binding to the late-endosomal resident proteins, p14 and p18 XREF_BIBR. Loss of individual components of the MP-1/p14/p18 complex reduces duration of the ERK1/2 activity, thus implicating late endosomes as an important platform for the ERK1/2 signaling XREF_BIBR. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus serve as platforms for the scaffold complex formed by BIT1 (Bcl-2 inhibitor of transcription) XREF_BIBR. It has been suggested that this complex provides a negative feedback to ERK1/2 signaling and impacts cell adaptation to stress and resistance to death XREF_BIBR.\n\nIn the present study, we analyzed how a putative scaffold protein Shoc2 contributes to the regulation of the ERK1/2 pathway. This leucine-repeat rich protein was first identified in C. elegans (named SOC-2/SUR-8), and demonstrated to interact differentially with various RAS proteins and positively regulate RAS-mediated signaling XREF_BIBR. The human homolog of SOC2/SUR-8 (Shoc2) was also shown to facilitate ERK1/2 signaling and interact with RAS and RAF, forming a ternary complex with these two proteins XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that Shoc2 regulates the rate of RAS-RAF interaction XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. In addition, Shoc2 was proposed to regulate ERK1/2 activity as part of a holoenzyme comprised of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase PP1C and Shoc2 XREF_BIBR. PP1C is recruited to RAF-1 via Shoc2 where it dephosphorylates an inhibitory residue Ser259 allowing for activation of RAF-1 by phosphorylation. Furthermore, Shoc2 was shown to modulate Ca 2+ - and calmodulin-dependent regulation of RAF-1 activation XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Recent studies reported that the S2G mutation in Shoc2 is associated with Noonan-like (NL) syndrome, a genetically inherited disease manifested in loose anagen hair XREF_BIBR. The latter study demonstrated that this mutation results in Shoc2 N-myristoylation and, therefore, mistargeting of Shoc2 to the plasma membrane.\n\nTo elucidate the mechanisms of regulation of the ERK1/2 activation cascade by Shoc2, we analyzed subcellular localization of Shoc2 and found that upon stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF), Shoc2 rapidly accumulated on a subset of late endosomes. RNAi knockdown and complementation experiments demonstrated that Shoc2 is required for the efficient ERK1/2 activation by EGF, and suggested that translocation to late endosomes may be a part of the regulatory mechanism which underlies Shoc2-dependent ERK1/2 activation.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nEGFR Activation Triggers Recruitment of Shoc2 to Endosomes.\n\nTo elucidate the mechanisms by which Shoc2 regulates the EGFR-RAS-ERK1/2 signaling cascade, sub-cellular localization of Shoc2 was studied using fluorescence microscopy. For studies in living cells, tagRFP (tRFP)-fusion protein of Shoc2 was prepared, in which tRFP was attached to the C- terminus of Shoc2. The ability of Shoc2-tRFP to associate with its interaction partner, RAS, was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of Shoc2-tRFP with HA-tagged H-RAS and M-RAS expressed in 293FT cells (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Shoc2-tRFP interaction with RAS proteins was abolished by a D175N mutation, previously shown to interfere with RAS binding XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Therefore, based on the demonstrated functionality of Shoc2-tRFP, we used this fusion protein in subsequent experiments.\n\nAnalysis of the subcellular localization of the transiently expressed Shoc2-tRFP in Cos1 cells by fluorescence microscopy revealed that Shoc2-tRFP displayed a cytosolic distribution in serum-starved cells (XREF_FIG). Shoc2-tRFP was also localized in the nucleus, and a small pool of the fusion protein was occasionally seen in intracellular vesicular structures. Upon activation of EGFR at 37degreesC, Shoc2-tRFP was found to be accumulated in the intracellular compartments (XREF_FIG). Such vesicular accumulation of Shoc2-tRFP reached a maximum level within 12-15 min following EGF stimulation and was maintained for an additional 20-30 min. Shoc2-tRFP containing vesicles were situated mostly in the perinuclear area of the cells. Some vesicles were relatively static, while most of the vesicles showed rapid lateral and directed movement over short distances, characteristic of microtubule-dependent endosome motility (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY).\n\nTo define Shoc2-tRFP containing vesicular compartments, Cos1 cells were transiently co-transfected with Shoc2-tRFP and either GFP-Rab5 or CFP-Rab7, resident proteins of early and late endosomes, respectively. Shoc2-tRFP was found in some CFP-Rab7 positive compartments (XREF_FIG) and very rarely present in early endosomes labeled with GFP-Rab5 (XREF_FIG). Shoc2-tRFP was not co-localized with internalized fluorescent transferrin, a marker of early and recycling endosomes (data not shown). These data suggest that Shoc2-tRFP containing compartments are likely to be late endosomes.\n\nTo confirm the finding of Shoc2 localization on endosomes, the distribution of endogenous Shoc2 was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In serum-starved HeLa or Cos1 (not shown) cells Shoc2 was found diffusely distributed throughout the cell (XREF_FIG). EGF treatment resulted in accumulation of a pool of Shoc2 in intracellular vesicular compartments in both cell types (XREF_FIG). The accumulation of endogenous Shoc2 in intracellular vesicles was more pronounced in HeLa cells, and therefore, majority of the following immunofluorescence experiments was carried in these cells. As in experiments in living cells, the subcellular distribution and shapes of individual Shoc2 containing structures were characteristic of endosomes or lysosomes. Hence, to examine the nature of Shoc2-containing compartments, the endosomal system of the cells was loaded with Dextran-A488(TM), and the cells were then treated with EGF. Significant co-localization of Shoc2 and Dextran-A488(TM) was observed in EGF-treated cells. Co-localization analysis of deconvoluted images revealed that approximately 32% of cellular Shoc2 was located in dextran-containing endosomes (XREF_FIG), indicating that Shoc2 compartments are indeed of an endosomal origin. The same extent of colocalization of Shoc2-containing vesicles was observed with GFP-Rab7 positive endosomes, suggesting that Shoc2 translocate to a sub-population of late endosomes. Interestingly, Shoc2 immunoreactivity was clustered along the perimeter of large Rab7-endosomes (XREF_FIG). Virtually no co-localization of Shoc2 with markers of early endosomes (EEA.1, Rab5) and lysosomes (LAMP1) was observed (XREF_FIG), suggesting that endogenous Shoc2 does not translocate to these compartments. Thus, Shoc2 compartments could be a specialized population of late endosomes.\n\nTo examine whether Shoc2 accumulated in endosomes containing internalized EGFR, we used COS-1 cells that express a relatively high level of endogenous EGFR and have large endosomes, which facilitates light microscopic analysis. Cos1 cells were stimulated with EGF, fixed and co-stained with EGFR and Shoc2 antibodies. While most of Shoc2 endosomes did not contain EGFR, a pool of Shoc2 was co-localized with endosomal EGFR (XREF_FIG). As in the case of Rab7 endosomes in HeLa cells (XREF_FIG), clusters of Shoc2 were often located in the membrane of large endosomes (likely multi-vesicular bodies) containing EGFR (XREF_FIG). Taken together, the data in XREF_FIG, XREF_FIG, and XREF_FIG suggest that a subset of multi-vesicular bodies and late endosomes is the main site of Shoc2 localization in EGF-stimulated cells.\n\n\n\nRAS Activity and Clathrin are Necessary for Shoc2 Localization to Endosomes.\n\nTo dissect the mechanisms of Shoc2 targeting to endosomes we tested whether activity of RAS, the key interacting partner of Shoc2, is necessary for the endosomal recruitment of Shoc2-tRFP. To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with YFP-H-RAS (S17N), a GDP bound mutant of RAS. This mutant is thought to have a dominant negative effect on the activity of RAS by occupying GTP-exchange factors of RAS XREF_BIBR, thus inhibiting EGF-induced, RAS-mediated ERK1/2 activation (XREF_FIG). Cells expressing and not expressing YFP-H-RAS (S17N) were treated with EGF at 37degreesC for 10 min and then stained with Shoc2 antibodies. XREF_FIG show that recruitment of Shoc2 to endosomes was impaired in cells overexpressing YFP-H-RAS (S17N) (outlined cells in upper panel of XREF_FIG). In cells that did not express or expressed low levels of YFP-H-RAS (S17N) recruitment of Shoc2 to endosomes was intact or slightly reduced. These results suggest that RAS activity is required for Shoc2 endosomal localization.\n\nTo investigate the role of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in Shoc2-tRFP targeting to endosomes, clathrin heavy chain (CHC) was depleted by siRNA. Knock-down of CHC with this duplex was previously demonstrated to efficiently block the endocytosis of EGF and transferrin XREF_BIBR. The cells were stimulated with a low concentration of EGF (2 ng/ml), conditions favoring internalization of EGF-receptor complexes predominantly via clathrin coated pits. The blockade of endocytosis of transferrin labeled with Alexa488 (Tfn-A488) was used as control for the efficiency of CHC depletion in individual cells. As shown in XREF_FIG, CHC siRNA dramatically reduced targeting of Shoc2-tRFP to endosomes (XREF_FIG). These data demonstrated that clathrin-dependent processes are involved in EGF-induced Shoc2-tRFP recruitment to endosomes.\n\n\n\nShoc2 (S2G) Mutant is not Targeted to Late Endosomes.\n\nHeterologous overexpression of the components of the ERK activation pathway and, in particular, scaffold proteins, in the presence of their endogenous counterparts often leads to the formation of non-specific complexes and sequesters binding partners from specific protein-protein interactions XREF_BIBR. Therefore, to perform structure-function analysis of the Shoc2 role in EGFR signaling to ERK1/2, we used an RNAi approach. First, the most efficient siRNA sequence among 4 siRNA duplexes targeting Shoc2 (duplex #1) was identified (data not shown). Depletion of Shoc2 using this siRNA duplex significantly reduced ERK1/2 activity in EGF-treated cells (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). The effect of Shoc2 knockdown was most evident when the cells were stimulated with a low (0.2 ng/ml) concentration of EGF (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Next, Cos1 cells with constitutive knock-down of Shoc2 (Cos1-LV1) were generated using lentiviruses carrying shRNA that was prepared based on the siRNA duplex #1 sequence. In order to prevent clonal variations due to the different sites of viral genome incorporation, a pool population of shRNA-expressing Cos-LV1 cells was used in subsequent experiments. XREF_FIG shows that constitutive depletion of Shoc2 protein resulted in the dramatic decrease in the extent of phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 upon EGFR activation. As expected, the effect of Shoc2 knockdown was most evident when the cells were stimulated with low (0.1-0.5 ng/ml) concentrations of EGF (XREF_FIG). Such EGF concentrations are detected in human plasma and most tissues where EGFR is accessible to EGF XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Transient expression of the Shoc2-tRFP mutant, in which 6 \"silent\" mutations were introduced to render it to be resistant to duplex #1 without changing its amino acid sequence (Shoc2-tRFP*), in Cos-LV1 cells has rescued EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (XREF_FIG). The ERK1/2 phosphorylation signal in these cells was lower than in parental COS1 cells, presumably, due to the fact that not all COS-LV1 cells expressed Shoc2-tRFP*.\n\nIt has been proposed that overexpression of the Shoc2 mutant with the S2G substitution (serine 2 is mutated to glycine), found in Noonan-like syndrome patients, results in N-myristoylation and targeting of this Shoc2 mutant to the plasma membrane, and enhances EGFR-dependent ERK1/2 activity XREF_BIBR. To test the effect of S2G mutation in the background of cells lacking endogenous Shoc2, the Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) mutant was transiently expressed in Cos-LV1 cells (XREF_FIG). At the expression levels that were maximally achievable for these constructs in Cos-LV1 cells, the Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) mutant was unable to restore the ERK1/2 activity above the basal level of EGF-induced ERK1/2 activity in Shoc2-depleted cells (XREF_FIG). These data suggest that the S2G mutation is inhibitory to the Shoc2 function in ERK activation.\n\nAnalysis of the subcellular localization of Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) using live-cell fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that in serum-starved Cos1-LVI cells Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) is located mainly in the plasma membrane (data not shown). It is likely that stable association of Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) with the membrane is mediated by its N-myristoylation and interactions of the cluster of positively-charged amino acids in the amino-terminus of Shoc2 (residues 5-60). After treatment with EGF the mutant was accumulated in endosome-like compartments (XREF_FIG, Movie S2). In contrast to endosomes containing wild-type Shoc2 (XREF_FIG, XREF_FIG, and XREF_FIG), the S2G mutant was highly co-localized with EGF-Alexa647 and YFP-H-RAS in endosomes (XREF_FIG). Moreover, Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) mutant was found to be well co-localized with endosomes containing CFP-Rab5, which was especially evident on \"donut-shape\" profiles of large endosomes (XREF_FIG). This pattern of localization in the plasma membrane and endosomes is reminiscent of the subcellular distribution of K-Ras that is modified by farnesylation (a fatty-acid modification similar to myristoylation) and has a positively-charged region in the proximity to the farnesylation site XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Most important, unlike wild-type Shoc2, Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) was not significantly co-localized with CFP-Rab7 (XREF_FIG). These data demonstrated that upon EGFR activation, Shoc2-tRFP* (S2G) is recruited to early endosomal compartments and that Shoc2 located on the plasma membrane and early endosomes is incapable of promoting ERK1/2 activation under conditions of cell stimulation with low EGF concentrations.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nAssembly of macromolecular signaling complexes in intracellular membrane compartments, such as endosomes, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, and its importance in orchestrating the network of signaling processes are well established XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Herein, we demonstrated endosomal localization of Shoc2, a putative scaffold protein that is important for signaling along the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Our immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging analyses showed that upon EGFR activation endogenous Shoc2 and transfected Shoc2-tRFP translocate to endosomes (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). Cordeddu and co-workers have previously reported that heterologously expressed and endogenous Shoc2 are present in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and that EGF stimulation causes translocation of cytosolic Shoc2 to membranes XREF_BIBR. In our experiments, a pool of Shoc2-tRFP was also found in cell nuclei regardless of EGF stimulation (XREF_FIG). However, we have not detected a significant nuclear pool of endogenous Shoc2 (XREF_FIG). It is possible that differences in immunofluorescence staining methods and cell types are accountable for different patterns of Shoc2 localization observed in our experiments and by Cordeddu and co-workers XREF_BIBR. On the other hand, consistent with the present study, the increased membrane pool of Shoc2 in EGF-stimulated cells XREF_BIBR could result from the recruitment of cytosolic Shoc2 to endosomes, given that Shoc2 was not detected in the plasma membrane. Hence, we propose that endosomes are the main site of EGF-dependent targeting of Shoc2 in cells used in our study. The nature of these endosomal compartments is not fully understood. Many of the Shoc2-containing vesicles accumulated non-specific endocytic cargo like dextran, although only a small pool of Shoc2 was detected on endosomes containing internalized EGFR (XREF_FIG). Moreover, Shoc2 was not detected in Rab5/EEA.1 containing early endosomes where most activated EGFRs were located, suggesting that Shoc2 is not associated with the classical \"signaling\" endosomes XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. The highest extent of co-localization of the vesicle-associated Shoc2 was with Rab7, and thus these Shoc2 compartments likely represent a subset of late endosomes.\n\nAs clathrin knock-down inhibited endosomal translocation of Shoc2 (XREF_FIG), the mechanism of EGF-induced Shoc2 targeting to late endosomes involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis of either EGFR or another protein that anchors Shoc2 to the endosomal membrane. Shoc2 recruitment to endosomes was also decreased dramatically in cells overexpressing dominant-negative H-RAS (N17S) (GDP-bound) mutant suggesting that Shoc2 targeting to endosomes is downstream of RAS activation (XREF_FIG). Since GTP-binding of RAS leads to membrane translocation of RAF and activation of its kinase, efficient Shoc2 relocation to endosomes may require RAF activity. Shoc2 was demonstrated to be a part of the PP1C enzymatic complex activity, that removes the inhibitory phosphate from Ser259 of RAF in response to the growth factor stimulation, thus allowing activation of RAF kinase XREF_BIBR. Interestingly, recently published data suggest that dephosphorylation of RAF S259 is the primary pathogenic mechanism in the activation of several RAF1 mutants identified in patients with Noonan syndrome XREF_BIBR, which emphasizes the role of the PP1C holoenzyme complex and Shoc2, particularly, in the regulation of ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, it is tempting to assume that endosomal targeting of Shoc2 can be a part of the positive feedback regulatory loop necessary for proper RAF activation.\n\nTo examine the role of Shoc2 translocation to late endosomes in ERK activation, we took advantage of the observation that a single amino acid change (S2G) results in N-myristoylation and aberrant targeting of Shoc2 (S2G) mutant to the plasma membrane XREF_BIBR and, in cells treated with EGF, to early (Rab5-positive, Rab7-negative) endosomes (XREF_FIG). To analyze Shoc2 function during signal transduction from EGFR using this Shoc2 mutant, we used an approach that involves the functional rescue of a shRNA-depleted endogenous Shoc2 by its tagRFP-fused wild-type or mutant version. Surprisingly, the S2G mutant did not rescue EGFR-mediated activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in Cos1 cells with constitutively depleted Shoc2, suggesting that S2G mutation inhibits Shoc2 function (XREF_FIG). These results appear to be inconsistent with the model proposed by Cordeddu and co-workers XREF_BIBR in which S2G is considered to be a gain-of-function mutation. This model was based on the observation of a slightly stronger effect of overexpressed Shoc2 (S2G) mutant on ERK1/2 activity in Neuro2A cells as compared with the effects of overexpressed wild-type Shoc2. However, several considerations may explain apparent inconsistencies of the data, and suggest that, at least in some experimental model systems, the S2G mutation is inhibitory to Shoc2 function during EGF-induced signaling to ERK1/2.\n\nFirstly, RNAi studies by others XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR and our experiments (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG) demonstrated that Shoc2 has significant role in EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation only when mammalian cultured cells, such as HeLa, HEK293 and Cos1, are stimulated with low, physiological concentrations of EGF (<1 ng/ml). Overexpression of wild-type or mutant Shoc2 increased the constitutive ERK1/2 activity, whereas the EGF-induced ERK1/2 activity was not changed XREF_BIBR. This effect was observed in Neuro2A but not in HEK293 and Cos1 cells. Secondly, genetic analysis of vulval development in C. elegans demonstrated that SOC-2 (S2G) expression did not rescue SOC-2 mutation (soc-2, ku167). However, it is unclear whether the perturbed development in the presence of S2G mutation is the result of increased RAF activation in the vulva XREF_BIBR. The effects of the S2G mutant may, therefore, be additionally attributed to mechanisms unrelated to the ERK activation pathway XREF_BIBR. It should also be pointed out that not all mutations associated with the Noonan syndrome and clinically related disorders have a gain-of-function effect, and in particular, Noonan-like syndrome patients with Shoc2 (S2G) mutations manifest defects consistent with the reduced cell proliferation XREF_BIBR. Thirdly, another level of complexity that can explain cell-dependent differences in the contribution of Shoc2 in ERK regulation is the existence of multiple forms of RAF that are activated and regulated by different and complex mechanisms. As an example, inhibition of the constitutively-active mutant of B-RAF by vemurafenib may lead to the compensatory up-regulation of signaling pathways leading to activation of c-RAF XREF_BIBR. Interestingly, targeting of another signaling protein MEK2 to late endosomes required A-RAF and c-RAF activity but was not supported by constitutively-active B-RAF XREF_BIBR. Finally, discrepancies in the data can be related to the differences in the experimental design. Our experimental model (Cos-LV1 cells) is reminiscent of the Noonan-like syndrome because Shoc2-S2G mutant was expressed in these cells in the absence of wild type Shoc2 (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). In experiments with Neuro2A cells, the S2G mutant was expressed in the presence of endogenous Shoc2 XREF_BIBR.\n\nWhile further experimentation is necessary to reconcile all the data described above, a hypothetic model of spatial regulation of Shoc2 function and the effects of S2G mutation can be proposed whereby Shoc2 is important for signaling from EGFR to ERK1/2 if rate-limiting interactions of participating signaling components are not saturated (low EGF concentrations). Under these conditions mis-targeting of Shoc2 due to the S2G mutation eliminates cytosolic and late-endosomal pools of Shoc2, and results in dramatic inhibition of ERK activation. Therefore, either cytosolic or late-endosomal, or both of these pools of Shoc2 are necessary for ensuring an effective signal transduction from activated EGFR to ERK. More specifically, we hypothesize that a pool of Shoc2 that is targeted to Rab7-positive endosomes is important for EGF-dependent ERK1/2 activation because this endosomal targeting occurs in an EGF and Ras-dependent manner. In contrast, the cytosolic Shoc2 pool is decreased upon EGF treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, ERK activity supported by EGFR-independent signaling pathways or in the presence of high EGF concentrations (30 ng/ml) XREF_BIBR can be enhanced by overexpression of the Shoc2 (S2G) mutant, probably, through the increase in the amount of Shoc2-RAS-RAF complexes at the plasma membrane and early endosomes. When expressed at very high levels (that are typically achieved in cells like Cos1 and HEK293) the Shoc2 (S2G) mutant may also increase signaling from the plasma membrane but additionally have a trans-inhibitory effect by preventing binding of Shoc2 interactors to the endogenous Shoc2 located in the cytosol and on late endosomes. We predict that, as in the case of stimulation of cells with high concentrations of EGF (XREF_FIG), constitutive activity of ERK1/2 would not be affected in Neuro2A and other cells by siRNA depletion of Shoc2.\n\nTo conclude, the critical role of Shoc2 during signaling to ERK1/2 under physiological conditions of EGFR activation is striking. Further detailed analysis of Shoc2 interactions and subcellular dynamics is in progress to generate a comprehensive model of Shoc2
