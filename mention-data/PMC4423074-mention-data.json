Genomic deletion or mutation of FBW7 has frequently been identified in many human cancers but not in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus it is important to know how the tumor suppressive function of FBW7 is impaired in pancreatic cancer. In this study, we first observed that low FBW7 expression correlated significantly with ERK activation in pancreatic cancer clinical samples, primarily due to KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer. We further showed that ERK directly interacted with FBW7 and phosphorylated FBW7 at Thr205, which sequentially promoted FBW7 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, the phospho-deficient T205A FBW7 mutant is resistant to ERK activation and could significantly suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. These results collectively demonstrate how the oncogenic KRAS mutation inhibits the tumor suppressor FBW7, thus revealing an important function of KRAS mutations in promoting pancreatic cancer progression.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of pancreatic cancer, is a devastating disease with a 5-year overall survival rate of < 5%, the highest fatality rate among all cancersXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. The incidence of pancreatic cancer remains equal to its mortality rate. Due to a lack of practical early diagnostic means and a high metastatic rate at initial diagnosis, only 15%-20% of patients are resectable 3 . Moreover, the 5-year survival rate among radically operated patients is only ~18%, due to early local or metastatic recurrence 4 . Therefore, the improvement of clinical practice is a pressing need, which requires a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development of PDAC.\n\nGenetically, PDAC progresses as a complex result of the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors. For example, oncogenic mutations in genes such as KRAS and loss-of-function mutation of tumor suppressors, such as p53, CDNK2A/p16, DPC4/SMAD4 and BRCA2, are frequently observed in PDACXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Mutations in KRAS were found in > 90% of patient specimens and were proposed to be initiators of PDAC. In addition, inactivating mutations of CDKN2A were detected in almost 95% of PDAC cases, making this gene the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor. In addition, mutations in p53, DPC4 and BRCA2 were identified in 75%, 50% and 5%-10% of PDAC cases, respectivelyXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Consistent with the genetic data, mouse models with activating KRAS mutations combined with p53 or DPC4 deletion exhibited accelerated PDAC development 7 , supporting the idea of a complex synergistic pro-tumor effect involving the alteration of both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.\n\nF-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7) is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex and is located within 4q32, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted in cancersXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. It has been well established that FBW7 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting multiple oncoprotein substrates for ubiquitination and degradation, including cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch-1, SREBP1 and Mcl-1XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR, thus regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. Hence, loss of function of FBW7 has been proposed to drive the progression of cancer. Indeed, deletion and mutation of FBW7 have been frequently identified in various human malignancies, such as gastric cancer 11 , colon cancer 12 , breast carcinoma 13 , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 14  and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 15 . Low expression of FBW7 is significantly correlated with poor prognosisXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Overall, ~6% of human tumors harbor mutations in FBW7 8 . Emerging evidence has also demonstrated that FBW7 is regulated by multiple protein factors, such as p53, Pin1, Hes-5 and Numb4, as well as microRNAs 16 . However, the function and regulation of FBW7 is poorly studied in the occurrence and progression of PDAC. Importantly, elevated KRAS activity stimulates many downstream signaling pathways. Evidence accumulated over the last few decades has demonstrated that the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in pancreatic cancer development and progression by contributing to cell cycle regulation, differentiation, proliferation, survival, migration and angiogenesisXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Previously, it was indicated that Ras activity may regulate cyclin E degradation via the FBW7 pathway 20 . This observation prompted us to investigate whether the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway plays a role in FBW7 degradation in PDAC.\n\nHerein, we report that FBW7 is rarely mutated and the protein level is significantly downregulated in PDAC, through a mechanism involving an activated Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. We demonstrate that ERK kinase directly interacts with and phosphorylates FBW7 at Thr205, which leads to the ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of FBW7 itself and the elevation of multiple FBW7 substrates, such as c-Myc, thus facilitating the proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of a phospho-deficient mutant of FBW7 (Thr205Ala) significantly reduced the tumorigenesis potential of PDAC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Through our experiments, we established a novel link between the oncogenic KRAS-mutant/MAPK/ERK signaling axis and the tumor suppressor FBW7 and revealed the mechanism underlying the impairment of FBW7 function in PDAC. These findings may help develop new therapeutic strategies to treat pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nFBW7 is downregulated in pancreatic cancer.\n\nTo investigate the role of FBW7 in PDAC progression, we first determined the expression level of FBW7 in various human pancreatic cancer cell lines with KRAS mutations (Aspc-1, Capan-1, CFPAC-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and SW1990). We found that FBW7 expression levels were significantly downregulated in six human pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal human pancreatic ductal epithelium (HPDE) cells (XREF_FIG). We then analyzed FBW7 expression in PDAC clinical samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tissue microarrays (TMAs), which contain 86 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissues. Based on staining intensity, we grouped the pancreatic tumor specimens according to FBW7 expression level as negative/weak, moderate, and strong (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). FBW7 was consistently downregulated in the tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues (XREF_FIG). Next, we explored the relationship between FBW7 expression and the clinicopathological features of PDAC. We found that decreased IHC signal of FBW7 correlated with poor tumor differentiation (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY; P = 0.017). However, no significant correlation was observed between FBW7 staining and tumor size, grade or lymph node metastasis (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY; P > 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log rank test showed that high FBW7 expression significantly correlated with better overall survival (OS) in PDAC (XREF_FIG; n = 86, P = 0.029). Thus, low expression of FBW7 is associated with high malignancy and poor prognosis in PDAC cases.\n\n\n\nExpression of FBW7 inversely correlates with ERK activation.\n\nKRAS mutation and the consequential activation of the MAPK kinase axis are regarded as major driving forces of PDAC progression. To explore the potential association of MAPK signaling and FBW7 expression, we first analyzed the levels of FBW7 and phospho-ERK (p-ERK), which represents the activation of MAPK signaling, in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Western blotting showed a general inverse correlation between the levels of FBW7 and p-ERK in all six pancreatic cancer cell lines examined (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Consistently, IHC staining also indicated an inverse correlation between the levels of FBW7 and p-ERK in human pancreatic cancer samples (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG; n = 86, P = 0.027). To further support this point, an inverse correlation between the levels of Fbw7 and p-Erk was detected on slides containing samples derived from Kras G12D  transgenic mice by IHC staining (XREF_FIG). Taken together, these results suggest that the abundance of FBW7 inversely correlates with ERK activation in PDAC.\n\n\n\nERK negatively regulates FBW7 stability.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that the activation of MAPK signaling negatively regulates FBW7, we examined the expression of FBW7 at both the mRNA and protein levels by q-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, upon overexpression of ERK1 kinase in two pancreatic cancer cell lines. Notably, the FBW7 mRNA level was barely affected (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). Besides, DNA methylation of FBW7 promoter region was also analyzed. There were 16 CpG sites at the promoter region of FBW7/hCDC4-alpha (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Bisulfate sequencing results demonstrated that CpG sites were seldom methylated. Moreover, overexpression of ERK had no detectable influence on the methylation status of CpG sites in the promoter region (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY), which is consistent with the transcriptional analysis of FBW7 upon ERK1 overexpression, indicating that FBW7 was regulated mostly via post-transcriptional modifications. As expected, the FBW7 protein level was significantly decreased upon overexpression of wild-type ERK1 but not the kinase-dead mutant (XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). As constitutive activation of ERK is observed in almost all pancreatic cell lines, we pretreated the pancreatic cancer cell lines with the MEK/ERK inhibitors (UO126, AZD6244, trametinib and SCH772984) to suppress ERK activity before harvesting and then determined FBW7 protein level. FBW7 protein levels significantly increased in response to inhibition of MAPK-ERK signaling in pancreatic cells (XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Similarly, downregulation of endogenous ERK1 by shRNA constructs significantly increased the abundance of FBW7 in SW1990 cells (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Furthermore, we performed the cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiment to determine the FBW7 half-life with or without UO126 treatment in PANC-1 cell lines. As expected, inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway dramatically extended the FBW7 half-life (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). These results suggest that activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway negatively regulates FBW7 stability in pancreatic cancer cells.\n\n\n\nERK interacts with FBW7.\n\nTo explore the mechanism by which ERK kinase modulates FBW7 stability, we investigated whether there is a direct interaction between FBW7 and ERK1. In a co-immunoprecipitation assay with ectopically expressed ERK1 and FBW7, we found that Flag-tagged FBW7 could precipitate HA-ERK1 from transfected 293T cells (XREF_FIG). Conversely, HA-ERK1 could also pull down Flag-FBW7 (XREF_FIG). In addition, the physical interaction between FBW7 and ERK1 was supported by experiments conducted on pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 stably expressing ERK1, which showed that ERK1 was able to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous FBW7 and vice versa (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). Furthermore, endogeneous interaction between FBW7 and ERK1 was validated by co-immunoprecipitation with FBW7 antibody (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nERK phosphorylates FBW7 at T205.\n\nAccording to a recent study, Threonine205-Proline206 is the only TP motif of FBW7, and this TP motif has been shown to be involved in FBW7 stability control 21 . Thus, we first validated T205 phosphorylation of endogenous FBW7 expressed in SW1990 cell line after MG132 treatment by mass spectrometry analysis and peptides containing phosphorylated T205 were successfully recovered (XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Next, we investigated whether ERK kinase directly phosphorylates FBW7, as they physically interact. We chose CFPAC-1 cells, which has a relatively higher FBW7 expression level. After UO126 treatment, the phosphorylation of endogenous FBW7 in the PDAC cell line CFPAC-1 was significantly reduced when detected with a phospho-Threonine-Proline (TP) monoclonal antibody (p-Thr-Pro-101) that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated TP motif (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). To further understand how ERK kinase phosphorylates FBW7 in vivo, we developed a specific antibody that only recognizes FBW7 phosphorylated at the T205 site. To validate the specificity of this antibody, we performed a dot blot assay and found that the phospho-T205-FBW7 (p-FBW7) antibody preferentially detected the phosphorylated peptide but not the unmodified peptide (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). We treated PANC-1 cells with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, and the phosphorylation of endogenous FBW7 in PANC-1 cells was also significantly reduced when detected with the specific p-FBW7 antibody (XREF_FIG). Similarly, after treatment with multiple MEK/ERK inhibitors, the phosphorylation of FBW7 in 293T cells all significantly decreased (XREF_FIG). Next, we conducted a series of experiments to determine whether T205 is indeed an ERK phosphorylation site. Notably, co-transfection of a constitutively active form of MEK1 (MEK1-CA) or ERK1 kinase dramatically increased the phosphorylation of wild-type FBW7 but not the T205A mutant, suggesting that MAPK kinase signaling indeed controls FBW7 phosphorylation status (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). Additionally, the phosphorylation of FBW7 by ERK was abolished by calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) treatment (XREF_FIG), indicating that ERK kinase modulates FBW7 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To prove that ERK kinase directly phosphorylates FBW7, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused recombinant FBW7 proteins, both wild type and T205A mutant, were incubated with purified HA-ERK1 kinase in the presence of ATP and detected with the p-FBW7 antibody. As shown in XREF_FIG, ERK kinase could also specifically phosphorylate FBW7 at T205 in vitro. Furthermore, we performed hot kinase assay by incubating purified ERK kinase with recombinant FBW7 proteins in the presence of gamma- 32 P-ATP and indeed the incorporation of  32 P was much reduced in T205A-FBW7 protein compared with WT-FBW7 (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Thus, these data together suggest that ERK kinase directly phosphorylates FBW7 at the T205 site.\n\n\n\nERK destabilizes FBW7 by promoting its ubiquitination.\n\nFBW7 is the substrate-binding unit of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets a group of phosphorylated proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, it has been previously reported that FBW7 itself undergoes post-translational regulations through ubiquitination-dependent proteosomal degradation when phosphorylated at the T205 site 21 . To test whether ERK kinase promotes FBW7 degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, we first treated cells with MG132 to block the proteasome pathway. Notably, although MG132 treatment led to an increase in total FBW7 protein, the upregulation of phosphorylated FBW7 was much more dramatic (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY), suggesting that phosphorylated FBW7 is indeed highly unstable. Next, we investigated whether ERK kinase regulates FBW7 ubiquitination. First, we observed that wild-type HA-ERK1, but not kinase-dead mutant, greatly increased the poly-ubiquitination of WT-FBW7 but not the T205A mutant (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). Moreover, depletion of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 by siRNA transfection or trametinib treatment significantly reduced the ubiquitination of FBW7 (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG), indicating an important role for ERK kinase in regulating FBW7 ubiquitination. Furthermore, co-transfection of Kras G12D  also significantly promoted the ubiquitination of FBW7 (XREF_FIG). Previously, it was reported that peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) regulates FBW7 ubiquitination when T205 is phosphorylated 21 . Thus, we hypothesized that ERK kinase promotes FBW7 ubiquitination in a Pin1-dependent manner. Indeed, depletion of endogenous Pin1 by siRNA drastically reversed the ERK-promoted poly-ubiquitination of FBW7 (XREF_FIG). Together, these data strongly suggest that ERK kinase promotes FBW7 ubiquitination in a T205 phosphorylation- and Pin1-dependent manner.\n\n\n\nT205 phosphorylation inhibits FBW7 tumor suppressor function in pancreatic cancer.\n\nGiven the critical role of Thr205 phosphorylation in controlling FBW7 stability, we continued to assess how this phosphorylation inhibits FBW7 tumor suppressor function in PDAC. First, we established SW1990 stable cell lines ectopically expressing wild-type FBW7 and a T205A phospho-deficient mutant, designated as SW1990/FBW7 WT  and SW1990/FBW7 T205A  respectively. In an anchorage-dependent growth assay, SW1990/FBW7 T205A  cells formed fewer and smaller colonies compared with its mock and SW1990/FBW7 WT  counterparts (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG). Moreover, SW1990/FBW7 T205A  also displayed much lower proliferation potential than SW1990 control and SW1990/FBW7 WT  cells (XREF_FIG). Furthermore, we also found that SW1990/FBW7 T205A  cells displayed a significant decrease in cell migration ability (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). To further confirm the in vitro phenotype of FBW7 T205A , we performed xenograft studies. In total, 4 x 10 6  cells of each cell line were subcutaneously inoculated into the backs of nude mice, and tumor growth was determined. As shown in XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG, although FBW7 WT  displayed a dramatic effect in tumor growth inhibition, which clearly demonstrated that the expression level of FBW7 is critical for blocking tumor progression, FBW7 T205A  still displayed a significantly stronger effect in reducing tumor volume than wild-type FBW7. Taken together, these results suggested that the FBW7 T205A mutant conferred a growth disadvantage on pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. FBW7 has been reported to target various oncoproteins for ubiquitination and degradation, such as cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch-1, SREBP1 and Mcl-1. To determine the major downstream substrate that FBW7 might target in PDAC, we next examined changes in the known substrates responding to FBW7 overexpression by western blot. Notably, among the 8 known substrates examined, only c-Myc showed a significant reduction in response to overexpression of FBW7 (XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). By contrast, other known FBW7 substrates, including cyclin E, c-Jun, Notch-1, SREBP1, PGC-1alpha, KLF5 and Mcl-1, were barely affected. Consistently, western blotting results also showed a general inverse correlation between the levels of FBW7 and c-Myc in all six pancreatic cancer cell lines examined (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Furthermore, the pathological correlation between FBW7 and c-Myc was further validated in specimens from xenograft tumors (XREF_FIG). Next, we examined whether the ERK/FBW7/c-Myc axis identified in PDAC cells is also valid in clinical samples. Correlation studies showed that a high p-ERK level correlated with low FBW7 expression and high c-Myc expression in PDAC specimens. Conversely, a low p-ERK level correlated with high FBW7 expression and low c-Myc expression (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). These results suggest that ERK kinase may exert its oncogenic function partially through elevating c-Myc expression by inhibiting FBW7 tumor suppressor function.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nGenerally, loss of function of tumor suppressors in cancer is frequently caused by mutation or deletion 22 . FBW7 is ranked among the most important tumor suppressors, with a relatively high mutation rate in cancer exceeded only by p53 and PTEN. Mutation of FBW7 has previously been reported in several types of cancerXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Overall, ~6% of tumors exhibited mutations in FBW7, with the highest mutation rates found in cholangiocarcinoma (35%) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (31%) 8 . However, in PDAC, FBW7 mutation was only reported in a study with limited samples (1 out of 11 samples) 23 . In a recent whole-exome sequencing analysis of 99 pancreatic cancer specimens, the top 16 most frequently mutated genes were identified, including KRAS and TP53 24 , but the FBW7 gene mutation status was not included. Similarly, our own sequencing results from 60 individual patients showed that < 2% of specimens exhibited FBW7 mutation (1 out of 60 samples; XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). These findings together suggest that FBW7 mutation is a rare event in PDAC. Interestingly, we found that FBW7 is expressed at a low level in PDAC and is tightly associated with cancer progression. FBW7 protein expression was significantly reduced in six pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal HPDE cells. The expression level of FBW7 in PDAC patients' TMAs suggested that the expression of FBW7 was downregulated in PDAC samples compared with paracancerous tissues. Importantly, low expression of FBW7 significantly correlates with poor OS in PDAC cases. Therefore, there must be a mechanism that inhibits FBW7 in PDAC without affecting FBW7 genetic status.\n\nKRAS mutation has been regarded as the most frequent oncogenic event in PDAC. Overall, oncogenic KRAS signaling in PDAC is through three major pathways: Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Pdk1/Akt and the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor pathway 25 . As the best characterized Ras downstream pathway, the MAPK signaling axis is of particular importance in PDAC development 17 . The pathway has been reported to play a central role in diverse cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Briefly, activated Ras binds to Raf, thereby directly activating MEK kinase via phosphorylation. MEK1/2 subsequently phosphorylates residues in the activation loops of ERK kinase, resulting in their activation. Upon activation, ERK kinase can phosphorylate and activate both cytosolic and nuclear targets 18 . Previously, Minella et al. 20  indicated that Ras stabilized cyclin E via the activation of the MAPK pathway and inhibition of FBW7-dependent cyclin E ubiquitination in vivo. However, the underlying mechanism was not further clarified. Inspired by their findings, we speculated that cross-talk may occur between FBW7 and the MAPK pathway. As expected, in the current study, we found that FBW7 levels are inversely correlated with ERK activation in PDAC. On one hand, ectopic expression of ERK1 significantly reduced the endogenous FBW7 protein level. On the other hand, inhibition of the MAPK pathway dramatically increased endogenous FBW7 abundance. By contrast, inhibition of AKT kinase dramatically shortened Fbw7 half-life, indicating the PI3K/AKT pathway may play a different role in regulating Fbw7 stability (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Furthermore, we found that ERK directly interacts with FBW7 and phosphorylates the T205 site to destabilize FBW7. Before our study, a report demonstrated that Pin1, the only peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, interacts with FBW7 in a phospho-T205-dependent manner and promotes FBW7 self-ubiquitination and protein degradation 21 . However, the signaling to trigger T205 phosphorylation, which is important for understanding the physiological regulation, was largely left untouched in that study. Hence, our research not only filled the missing upstream signaling that controls FBW7 stability via the T205 site but also identified new functions of the KRAS-MAPK kinase pathways in PDAC. Interestingly, a similar regulation paradigm between other oncogenic kinase and tumor suppressing proteins has also been reported. For example, decreased p27 expression levels in tumor cells mostly occur due to enhanced proteolysis, given that mutation of the p27 gene is a rare event in cancer. This low expression level is well explained by the finding that cylin A/CDK2 phosphorylates the CDK inhibitor p27 and triggers its destruction by the oncoprotein SCF-SKP2 in many cancer types 26 , such as oral squamous cell carcinoma 27 . Another example is that the oncoprotein NEDD4-1 negatively regulates the stability of the tumor suppressor PTEN by catalyzing PTEN polyubiquitination and destruction in lung cancerXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Thus, in addition to genetic mutations, accelerated protein turnover upon certain post-translational modification is another important means by which oncoproteins inactivate tumor suppressors during tumorigenesis. To dissect a possible role of self-ubiquitination in ERK-mediated FBW7 degradation, we generated a FBW7 R465H mutant that could not ubiquitinate substrates based on a previous report 21 . As shown in XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY, R465H is more heavily ubiquitinated than WT FBW7, which is consistent with the previous report. Co-transfected ERK kinase could still promote poly-ubiquitination of the R465H mutant, which possibly indicates the involvement of other E3 ligases in FBW7 stability control, but the possibility of self-ubiquitination can not be formally excluded. Furthermore, we generated T205E FBW7 construct. As shown in XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY, T205E mutant failed to form homo-dimer as WT and T205A FBW7 did. We also tested the ubiquitination potential of T205E, and interestingly T205E are less ubiquitinated than WT (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). Although the T-->E mutation generated a negative charge at aa205, which is similar to what a phosphor group does after phosphorylation, Pin1 isomerase does not interact with EP motif and could not perform the cis-trans conversions. Thus, the T205E mutant may not be appropriate to be used to evaluate the regulatory effect involving Pin1. Overall, our study established an important regulatory function of FBW7 by the activated RAS-MAPK-ERK signaling pathway, although more efforts are required to dissect how FBW7 is ubiquitinated after its phosphorylation.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that FBW7 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting multiple well-known oncoproteins for degradation. However, the functional role of FBW7 in PDAC progression has not yet been well studied, although a recent stem cell study reported that FBW7 deletion in the adult pancreatic ducts induces the direct conversion of ductal cells into beta cells 30 . In our study, by overexpressing the phospho-deficient mutant form of FBW7 (FBW7 T205A  mutant), we observed a remarkable growth disadvantage in pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. To uncover the underlying molecular mechanism, we examined the changes in many known FBW7 substrates, such as cyclin E 31 , c-Myc 32 , c-Jun 33 , Notch-1 34 , SREBP1 35 , PGC-1alpha 36 , KLF-5 37  and Mcl-1 38 . Intriguingly, only the level of c-Myc decreased significantly, suggesting a central role for c-Myc in FBW7-mediated PDAC inhibition. c-Myc is one of the most frequently dysregulated oncogenes in human malignancies, and it regulates multiple processes including uncontrolled cell proliferation, cell growth, genomic instability and tumor cell metabolismXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Previous studies have also demonstrated that high levels of c-Myc are frequently detected in pancreatic cancer and promote the progression of pancreatic cancerXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Recent studies have shown that the expression levels of mutant KRAS and c-Myc share equal importance in the initiation and maintenance of pancreatic cancerXREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. Therefore, through the phosphorylation and inhibition of FBW7, the KRAS-MAPK axis may mainly rescue c-Myc expression to trigger a major alteration in the transcription profile towards malignancy and cell growth advantage. However, further studies are required to determine whether other substrates, in addition to c-Myc, contribute to this phenotype in PDAC.\n\nIn summary, by exploring signaling pathways unique to PDAC and absent from other types of cancer, we demonstrated for the first time that the oncogenic KRAS-MAPK signaling cascade, one of the major driving forces for PDAC progression, phosphorylates the tumor suppressor FBW7 at the T205 site and promotes FBW7 ubiquitination and destruction. Thus, the dysregulation of FBW7 substrates, such as c-Myc, promotes tumorigenesis and poor clinical prognosis (XREF_FIG). These findings have revealed important aspects of the functional roles of oncogenic KRAS signaling in PDAC and may contribute to designing new therapeutic strategies to treat pancreatic cancer.\n\n","sentences":[{"words":["ERK","kinase","phosphorylates","and","destabilizes","the","tumor","suppressor","FBW7","in","pancreatic","cancer","."],"startOffsets":[0,4,11,26,30,43,47,53,64,69,72,83,89],"endOffsets":[3,10,25,29,42,46,52,63,68,71,82,89,90],"tags":["NN","NN","VBZ","CC","VBZ","DT","NN","NN","NN","IN","JJ","NN","."],"lemmas":["erk","kinase","phosphorylate","and","destabilize","the","tumor","suppressor","fbw7","in","pancreatic","cancer","."],"entities":["B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-TissueType","I-TissueType","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","B-VP","I-VP","I-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":2,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":2,"destination":3,"relation":"cc"},{"source":2,"destination":4,"relation":"conj"},{"source":2,"destination":8,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":8,"destination":5,"relation":"det"},{"source":8,"destination":6,"relation":"nn"},{"source":8,"destination":7,"relation":"nn"},{"source":8,"destination":9,"relation":"prep"},{"source":9,"destination":11,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":11,"destination":10,"relation":"amod"}],"roots":[2]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":1,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":2,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":2,"destination":4,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":2,"destination":8,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":4,"destination":1,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":8,"destination":5,"relation":"det"},{"source":8,"destination":6,"relation":"nn"},{"source":8,"destination":7,"relation":"nn"},{"source":8,"destination":11,"relation":"prep_in"},{"source":11,"destination":10,"relation":"amod"}],"roots":[2]}}},{"words":["F-box","and","WD","repeat","domain","containing","7","(","FBW7",")","is","the","substrate","recognition","component","of","the","Skp1-Cul1-F-box","(","SCF",")","ubiquitin","ligase","complex","and","functions","as","a","major","tumor","suppressor","by","targeting","various","oncoproteins","for","degradation","."],"startOffsets":[94,100,104,107,114,121,132,134,135,139,141,144,148,158,170,180,183,187,203,204,207,209,219,226,234,238,248,251,253,259,265,276,279,289,297,310,314,325],"endOffsets":[99,103,106,113,120,131,133,135,139,140,143,147,157,169,179,182,186,202,204,207,208,218,225,233,237,247,250,252,258,264,275,278,288,296,309,313,325,326],"tags":["NN","CC","NN","NN","NN","VBG","CD","-LRB-","NN","-RRB-","VBZ","DT","NN","NN","NN","IN","DT","NN","-LRB-","NN","-RRB-","NN","NN","NN","CC","VBZ","IN","DT","JJ","NN","NN","IN","VBG","JJ","NNS","IN","NN","."],"lemmas":["f-box","and","wd","repeat","domain","contain","7","(","fbw7",")","be","the","substrate","recognition","component","of","the","skp1-cul1-f-box","(","scf",")","ubiquitin","ligase","complex","and","function","as","a","major","tumor","suppressor","by","target","various","oncoprotein","for","degradation","."],"entities":["B-Family","O","B-Simple_chemical","O","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":0,"destination":1,"relation":"cc"},{"source":0,"destination":2,"relation":"conj"},{"source":4,"destination":0,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":5,"relation":"vmod"},{"source":5,"destination":6,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":6,"destination":8,"relation":"appos"},{"source":14,"destination":15,"relation":"prep"},{"source":14,"destination":4,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":14,"destination":24,"relation":"cc"},{"source":14,"destination":25,"relation":"conj"},{"source":14,"destination":10,"relation":"cop"},{"source":14,"destination":11,"relation":"det"},{"source":14,"destination":12,"relation":"nn"},{"source":14,"destination":13,"relation":"nn"},{"source":15,"destination":17,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":17,"destination":16,"relation":"det"},{"source":17,"destination":19,"relation":"appos"},{"source":17,"destination":23,"relation":"dep"},{"source":23,"destination":21,"relation":"nn"},{"source":23,"destination":22,"relation":"nn"},{"source":25,"destination":31,"relation":"prep"},{"source":25,"destination":26,"relation":"prep"},{"source":26,"destination":30,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":30,"destination":27,"relation":"det"},{"source":30,"destination":28,"relation":"amod"},{"source":30,"destination":29,"relation":"nn"},{"source":31,"destination":32,"relation":"pcomp"},{"source":32,"destination":34,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":32,"destination":35,"relation":"prep"},{"source":34,
