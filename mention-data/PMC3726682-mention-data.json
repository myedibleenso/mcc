Proteins with antioxidant functions may protect fungal cells against reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species generated by phagocytic cells, thus acting as potential virulence factors. Ras GTPases are involved in stress responses, cell morphology, and differentiation in a range of organisms. Ras, in its activated form, interacts with effector proteins and can initiate a kinase cascade. In lower eukaryotes, Byr2 kinase represents a Ras target. The present study investigated the role of Ras in P. brasiliensis after in vitro stimulus with ROS or RNS. We have demonstrated that low concentrations of H 2 O 2  (0.1 mM) or NO 2  (0.1-0.25 microM) stimulated P. brasiliensis yeast cell proliferation and that was not observed when yeast cells were pre-incubated with farnesyltransferase inhibitor. We constructed an expression plasmid containing the Byr2 Ras-binding domain (RBD) fused with GST (RBD-Byr2-GST) to detect the Ras active form. After stimulation with low concentrations of H 2 O 2  or NO 2 , the Ras active form was observed in fungal extracts. Besides, NO 2  induced a rapid increase in S-nitrosylated Ras levels. This alternative posttranslational modification of Ras, probably in residue Cys123, would lead to an exchange of GDP for GTP and consequent GTPase activation in P. brasiliensis. In conclusion, low concentrations of H 2 O 2  or NO 2  stimulated P. brasiliensis proliferation through Ras activation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nParacoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermo-dependent dimorphic fungus responsible for paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a systemic mycosis that is prevalent in Latin America. The major protective host immune response against P. brasiliensis is mediated by cells, as evidenced by granuloma formation XREF_BIBR. The interaction between P. brasiliensis and alveolar macrophages is a crucial step for the establishment and progression of infection in susceptible hosts. The yeast pathogenic phase of P. brasiliensis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that is able to survive and replicate within the phagosome of inactivated murine and human macrophages XREF_BIBR. By contrast, macrophages can engulf this microorganism and confine it within phagosomes where, by action of microbicidal molecules and/or by restriction of essential nutrients, the pathogen can be destroyed. Among the molecules that exert fungicidal action in phagosomes are hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), nitric oxide (NO) and their derivatives. These are generated by NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), respectively XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Immune system cells activate the NADPH oxidase complex to generate radical superoxide (O 2  - ), which is subsequently converted into H 2 O 2 . Macrophages express iNOS with activation of the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway, and subsequent NO production.\n\nThe ability of pathogenic fungi to cause disease is related to their ability to survive in the host. Many microorganisms evolved strategies to survive in hostile conditions, like those within phagocytic cells. While studying P. brasiliensis transcriptional responses after internalization by murine macrophages, Tavares et al. XREF_BIBR showed an increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant molecules like SOD, and proteins like Hsp60 involved in thermal stress. This work has clearly demonstrated that the parasite has antioxidant mechanisms and responds to oxidative and nitrosative stress XREF_BIBR. Evidence has increased to support the idea that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may have an important role as regulators of signal transduction, being able to participate in signaling pathways associated with physiological and pathophysiological processes XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR.\n\nSignaling pathways that control morphological changes, cell proliferation and stress response in P. brasiliensis are largely unknown, but in other dimorphic fungi the involvement of cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) is known to be an important factor in this process XREF_BIBR. Modulation of MAP kinases is an important and highly conserved event in eukaryotes. It is composed of a series of protein kinases, which can sequentially phosphorylate other proteins so that the signal transmissions from the point of origin (typically the cell membrane) to the nucleus can occur XREF_BIBR. As a result, the target molecules (including transcription factors) are phosphorylated XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. In this context, the Ras protein is prominent in the regulation of signal transduction pathways that mediate adaptive changes. Ras belongs to a large family of low molecular-weight proteins (21 kDa) with GTPase activity. Ras GTPases are molecular switches that are active when GTP-bound and inactive when GDP-bound. Both processes are regulated by enzymatic reactions. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyze the release of GDP from the guanine nucleotide-binding pocket, mediating the exchange of GDP for GTP. The activation state of Ras is self-limited by its intrinsic GTPase activity, which is enhanced to critical regulatory levels by GTPase-activating enzymes (GAPs) XREF_BIBR. Ras is involved in signal transduction pathways connecting events from many cell surface receptors to intracellular processes XREF_BIBR. In mammals, depending on the cellular context, Ras activation can stimulate cell division cycle, morphogenesis, differentiation, or apoptosis XREF_BIBR.\n\nIn microorganisms, the Ras protein is similarly involved in growth and development processes, morphological changes, and stress responses. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, among other fungi, two Ras isoforms (Ras1 and Ras2) have been identified XREF_BIBR. Waugh et al. XREF_BIBR demonstrated that C. neoformans Ras proteins share some degree of functional redundancy, since both Ras1 and Ras2 mutants were viable and phenotypically similar to wild type. In Trichoderma reesei, both Ras1 and Ras2 play similar roles in morphogenesis and adjusting cAMP level, but Ras2 is also involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression XREF_BIBR. Differential functions of Ras1 and Ras2 were also described in Beauveria bassiana\nXREF_BIBR. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe only Ras1 was identified, which controls two different downstream signaling pathways XREF_BIBR. However, endomembrane Ras activates a Cdc42 pathway to mediate cell polarity, while plasma membrane Ras selectively regulates a MAP kinase pathway to mediate mating pheromone signalling XREF_BIBR.\n\nRas proteins are conserved at the N-termini, but differ substantially at the C-termini, where 10-20 amino acids form the hypervariable region. Ras proteins are anchored to the membranes by a series of post-translational modifications occurring at the C-terminus. Anchoring of Ras in membranes is believed to be absolutely required for biological activity. Ras proteins contain a CAAX motif at the C-terminus (C=cysteine, A=aliphatic amino acid, and X=any amino acid), where farnesyl transferase-mediated cysteine farnesylation occurs in the cytosol. This posttranslational modification prompts Ras association with the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Farnesylation is followed by the cleavage of the three C-terminal residues (AAX) and subsequent carboxymethylation of the farnesyl-cysteine XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR.\n\nIn P. brasiliensis, two Ras isoforms were characterized with important roles during fungal dimorphism, thermal stress, and in parasite-host interactions XREF_BIBR. The prenylation site (CAAX) was detected in both isoforms, but with variable sequences (CVIM in Ras1 and CLIL in Ras2) XREF_BIBR. Nevertheless, nothing is known about GTPases functions in P. brasiliensis for adaptive responses to oxidative and nitrosative stress. In the present study, we investigated the importance of P. brasiliensis Ras GTPase after in vitro stimulation with ROS and RNS. Using a novel probe that detects activated Ras (Ras-GTP), we showed that low concentrations of NO and H 2 O 2  mediate cell signaling triggered with the participation of Ras, leading to cell proliferation in P. brasiliensis. Furthermore, we showed that Ras is S-nitrosylated in our test conditions. Therefore, this work shows the beneficial role of Ras activation by low levels of ROS and RNS in P. brasiliensis cell proliferation.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\n3.1. Low concentrations of ROS and RNS induced cell proliferation in P. brasiliensis.\n\nIt is known that different levels of H 2 O 2  or NO can induce distinct responses within a cell XREF_BIBR. For example, different transcriptional responses are induced by low (sub-toxic) or high (toxic) levels of H 2 O 2  or NO in mammalian cells, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe\nXREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. To better understand this type of stimulus in P. brasiliensis, logarithmic growing yeast cells, were cultured in F12 medium for 24 h and subsequently treated in vitro with different concentrations of H 2 O 2  (0.05-30 mM) and NO 2  (0.1-1000 microM) for 5 h at 37degreesC and the CFU count was assessed (XREF_FIG). For cells pre-incubated for 5 h with higher concentrations of H 2 O 2  (10, 15 and 30 mM) and NO 2  (1, 10, 100 and 1000 microM), a typical dose-response curve with decreased cell viability was observed (XREF_FIG). For intermediate concentrations of H 2 O 2  (0.5 and 1 mM) and NO 2  (0.5 microM) there was no change in cell viability (XREF_FIG). However, yeast cells pre-incubated with low concentrations H 2 O 2  (0.1 mM) and NO 2  (0.25 microM) responded with significant cell proliferation (3.7+/-0.16x10 3  and 1.8+/-0.17x10 3  CFU, respectively) when compared to unstimulated controls (2.13+/-0.19x10 3  and 1.35+/-0.78x10 3  CFU, respectively). Maximum stimulation of fungal proliferation was observed after incubation with 0.1 mM H 2 O 2  and 0.25 microM NO 2 . These data suggested that P. brasiliensis may benefit from low concentrations of ROS and RNS to proliferate.\n\n\n\n3.2. Ras participates in P. brasiliensis proliferation dependent on low concentrations of ROS or RNS.\n\nIn mammals, one of the major components involved in cell proliferation triggered by ROS and RNS is Ras XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Ras must undergo carboxyterminal farnesylation before localizing at the cytoplasmatic side of the plasma membrane XREF_BIBR. FPT III, a potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme farnesyl transferase (FTase), efficiently prevents Ras farnesylation XREF_BIBR. To determine if redox-stimulated cell proliferation is dependent on Ras activation, yeast cells were preincubated for 24-h with FPT III before H 2 O 2  or NO 2  exposure. As shown in XREF_FIG, the growth stimulatory effect with 0.1 mM H 2 O 2  and 0.25 microM NO 2  was blocked in presence of this inhibitor (XREF_FIG). These results suggested that Ras participates in the cellular proliferation process induced by low concentrations of ROS or RNS.\n\nWe also tested the effect of low concentrations of H 2 O 2  and NO 2  during fungal growth. P. brasiliensis was incubated with or without stimulus in the presence or absence of Ras inhibitor. We observed significant increase in the number of cells growing in the presence of 0.1 mM H 2 O 2  (5.837+/-0.825x10 6  cells) and 0.25 microM of NO 2  (3.61+/-0.082x10 6  cells) after 4 days when compared to controls (2+/-0.83x10 6  cells and 1.63+/-0.288x10 6  cells, respectively) (XREF_FIG), however this effect was abolished in the presence of FPT III. We observed similar results after 8 days of growth (data not shown). However, on the twelfth day there was no statistical difference between the experimental samples and controls (data not shown). Therefore, these results confirm that low concentrations (sub-toxic) of ROS and RNS can lead to P. brasiliensis cell proliferation and that Ras farnesylation is required for this event.\n\n\n\n3.3. Low concentrations of ROS or RNS promote Ras activation in P. brasiliensis.\n\nTo understand the contribution of Ras on P. brasiliensis redox-dependent proliferation, we evaluated its activation after stimulation with low concentrations of H 2 O 2  and NO 2 . In order to do that, we constructed a probe that detects Ras active form (Ras-GTP). In fungi, the serine/threonine kinase Byr2 (Ste11 homologue in S. cereviseae) is known to be responsible for the interaction with activated Ras. In P. brasiliensis, the Byr2 gene is composed of four exons separated by three introns. BYR2 has 2,685 bp and encodes a protein of 894 amino acids. The Ras Binding Domain (RBD) shows conserved Ras interaction regions (XREF_FIG), as observed in the alignment of Byr2-RBD with its fungal homologues from A. niger, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, and with human Raf-1. The RBD is located in a regulatory region at the N-terminal, between amino acids 216 and 395. According to Scheffzek et al. XREF_BIBR, the Byr2-RBD amino acid residues from S. pombe responsible for the interaction with Ras would be Arg74, Lys101, Ala84, Arg83, Thr82, Gln81, and Arg160. All residues are preserved in P. brasiliensis Byr2-RBD, suggesting that the intermolecular interaction with activated Ras may also occur (XREF_FIG).\n\nThe use of a RBD-GST probe in studies on cell signaling is widespread to detect Ras activity in mammalian cells XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR; however, in fungi there are only few studies using this strategy XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. We constructed an expression plasmid containing approximately 537 pb of the Byr2-RBD gene fragment subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-2 vector. The cloned fragment corresponds to Byr2 amino acids 216-395 (179 amino acids) that include the whole RBD. For expression of the recombinant protein (RBD-GST probe), the expression vector was introduced into E. coli BL21 and induced with 1 mM of IPTG at 37degreesC or 30degreesC. After 3 hours of induction in both temperatures a component of approximately 43 kDa was expressed, which is consistent with the expected molecular mass of the recombinant protein (XREF_FIG). The solubility of recombinant RBD(Byr2)-GST was evaluated and we observed that at 37degreesC most of the fusion protein was expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies (XREF_FIG). However, at 30degreesC we observed that a greater proportion of the RBD(Byr2)-GST recombinant protein was found in the bacterial extract soluble fraction (XREF_FIG). To determine specificity of the probe RBD(Byr2)-GST in detecting Ras-GTP we performed in vitro exchange experiments. We incubated Pb18 total extract with high amounts of GTP or GDP, probed it with RBD(Byr2)-GST and immunoblotted the precipitate with anti-Ras. Only activated Ras (Ras-GTP) was able to bind to the probe RBD(Byr2)-GST (XREF_FIG), indicating that the assay is specific for Ras-GTP.\n\nWe next used the RBD(Byr2)-GST probe to assess the ability of low concentrations of ROS and RNS to activate Ras. Ras activity was determined in P. brasiliensis yeasts exposed to 0.1 mM H 2 O 2  and 0.25 microM NO 2  for increasing periods of time. Early Ras activation was observed after 15 min of stimulation with ROS and RNS (XREF_FIG). Maximum Ras activation was observed after 60 min of incubation (XREF_FIG), and at latter timepoints (180 and 300 min) we observed decrease of Ras activation. Also, the fungal protein extract was incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose beads alone (negative control) and analyzed by Western blot, but no reaction was observed (data not shown). The protein loading of the samples used in the Ras activity assay observed in SDS-PAGE gel stained Coomassie blue proved to be fairly homogeneous (data not shown). We also evaluated by RT-PCR the transcription levels of RAS1 and RAS2 in P. brasiliensis after incubation with 0.1 mM H 2 O 2  or 0.25 microM NO 2 , but no significant changes were observed (data not shown). Therefore, low concentrations of ROS and RNS promoted guanine nucleotide exchanges in the critical cellular signaling protein Ras.\n\nWe also investigated the inhibitory effect of farnesyl transferase in Ras activity. Yeast cells were cultivated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 250 microM FPT III, followed by treatment for 1 h with 0.1 mM H 2 O 2  or 0.25 microM nitrite. As shown in XREF_FIG, FPT III substantially inhibited Ras activation in yeast cells of P. brasiliensis treated with low concentration of ROS or RNS, as compared with controls without inhibitor.\n\n\n\n3.4. NO 2  promotes Ras S-nitrosylation in P. brasiliensis.\n\nIt has been shown that NO stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange in Ras and that this event is dependent on S-nitrosylation, which occurs in the active thiol group Cys118 XREF_BIBR. Initially we checked whether nitrosylable Cys was conserved in P. brasiliensis. By aligning a small fragment of the C-terminal region from different fungi and human Ras, we observed that in P. brasiliensis Ras1 there is a Cys homologue at position 123, whereas in Ras2 there is a serine at this position (XREF_FIG). Then we used a computer program (http://dbSNO.mbc.nctu.edu.tw, XREF_BIBR) to predict putative S-nitrosylation sites in P. brasiliensis Ras and detected that Cys123 would be a likely S-nitrosylation site with 95% prediction specificity (XREF_FIG). Cys123 is localized in the Ras GTP binding and interaction site (G3) (XREF_FIG). Ras2 also showed probable S-nitrosylation sites at Cys55 and Cys176; however, these sites are located elsewhere in the molecule (data not shown). We also evaluated whether Cys123 would be located in Ras hydrophobic region. According to Hess et al. XREF_BIBR local hydrophobicity might promote specific S-nitrosylation. Analysis of the deduced P. brasiliensis Ras1 and Ras2 sequences showed that Cys123 is inserted in Ras1 hydrophobic domain with low surface-probability in the protein (XREF_FIG). Moreover, this feature was not observed in the equivalent Ras2 region. These results suggested that Ras1 Cys123 bears S-nitrosylation features. Therefore, we verified if Ras1 was possibly S-nitrosylated by the biotin switch test XREF_BIBR, which introduces a biotin molecule in the S-nitrosylated Cys (XREF_FIG). The detection of S-nitrosylated protein by the biotin switch method is dependent on treatment with ascorbate, consistent with the reduction dependent on ascorbate from nitrosothiol bonds (XREF_FIG). For that, we studied whether lower concentrations of NO 2  (0.25 microM) or H 2 O 2  (0.1 mM) would be able to induce Ras1 S-nitrosylation. We found that NO 2  induced rapid increase in S-nitrosylated Ras levels, with a peak at 30 min (XREF_FIG). On the other hand, no change in the level of S-nitrosylation was observed after treatment with H 2 O 2  (XREF_FIG). These findings suggested that NO probably plays an important role in the process of Ras activation through its S-nitrosylation.\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nThe ability of pathogenic fungi to resist the deleterious effects of ROS and/or RNS is foreseen as an important virulence mechanism, particularly in relation to its contact with phagocytic host cells. We have here demonstrated that sub-toxic concentrations of ROS and RNS are capable of stimulating P. brasiliensis cell proliferation in a Ras GTPase activation-dependent manner. In addition, we observed that stimulation with NO 2  evoked Ras S-nitrosylation, which has not been observed after stimulation with H 2 O 2 . Cell proliferation upon ROS and RNS stimulation have not been reported before in fungi; however, it remains to be clarified if this phenomenon would occur in P. brasiliensis isolates from other phylogenetic groups XREF_BIBR, or even in isolates of the recently separated species P. lutzii\nXREF_BIBR, apart from virulent Pb18 presently tested. Pb18 represents the main S1 phylogenetic P. brasiliensis group XREF_BIBR.\n\nIt has frequently been observed that high concentrations of both ROS and RNS are cytotoxic to fungal cells, causing cell death, and this is an effector mechanism of the immune system cells XREF_BIBR. However, NADPH oxidase knockout mice (deficient for ROS production) showed decreased fungal spread when intratracheally infected with C. neoformans, and were also protected against pulmonary infection XREF_BIBR. This event, which seems to contradict the literature, may suggest that the microorganisms could somehow benefit from ROS/RNS derived from immune system cells. Our data suggests that one possible mechanism would be by direct contact of the fungus with sub-toxic concentrations of NO 2  and H 2 O 2 , but that remains to be tested in C. neoformans. Despite the proliferation induced by low doses of ROS and RNS having been previously demonstrated in mammalian cells XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, this is the first report of stimulation of fungal cell growth by ROS/RNS. Recently, Srinivasa et al. XREF_BIBR showed that both low (<1 mM) and high (4-10 mM) concentrations of exogenous H 2 O 2  induce filamentous growth with distinct cell morphology and growth rate in C. albicans, which suggests a differential transcriptional response. The authors demonstrated that sub-toxic doses of H 2 O 2  induce the formation of pseudohyphae.\n\nIn experimental PCM, NO has dual roles. Brummer et al. XREF_BIBR have demonstrated that activation of mouse (BALB/c) peritoneal macrophages by IFN-gamma enhances the fungicidal activity. In contrast, macrophages from A/J mice were poorly activated by low doses of IFN-gamma, and secreted only low amounts of IL-12, NO, thus showing poor fungicidal ability XREF_BIBR. Nascimento et al. XREF_BIBR showed that NO is essential for host resistance to infection by P. brasiliensis. The authors found that mice genetically deficient for iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) were susceptible to infection by the fungus. On the other hand, the persistent production of NO was correlated with increased infection by P. brasiliensis\nXREF_BIBR. Our in vitro data suggests that one possible alternatively mechanism of fungal proliferation in vivo would be by direct contact of the fungus with sub-toxic concentrations of NO 2  and H 2 O 2 .\n\nIn our study we observed that there was decrease in Ras activity after incubation with FPT III (XREF_FIG). Previous results with the P. brasiliensis showed that farnesylation blockage interfered with vegetative growth of yeast cells and stimulated germinative tube production even at 37degreesC XREF_BIBR. Since the farnesylation inhibitor is not specific for Ras incorporation into the membrane, the effects observed in our work could be result from the inhibition of the other Ras-related proteins that are also farnesylated XREF_BIBR. However, several studies reported the strong involvement of Ras protein in fungal growth and differentiation after different stimuli XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Furthermore, it is known that ROS and RNS are involved in Ras-dependent cell proliferation XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR and fungal conidiation XREF_BIBR. Thus, it is possible speculate that the FPT III effect on fungal growth and Ras activity were dependent on decreasing Ras activity in the same cell (XREF_FIG).\n\nBy using a probe developed to detect active Ras, we also demonstrated that, as in mammal cells, P. brasiliensis Ras may participate in cell proliferation in a redox-dependent manner. Thus, GTPase Ras is a highly preserved signaling protein that transmits receptor signals from the cell surface to a variety of effectors, thereby regulating important physiological processes such as growth, morphology, and survival in eukaryotes from yeast to humans. Moreover, it can regulate virulence in human pathogenic fungi XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Ras can be activated by different stimuli, and it is known that ROS and RNS can induce this process XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR. It is known, for example, that NO, a free radical with signaling properties XREF_BIBR, stimulates human Ras activity by S-nitrosylation of the Cys118 residue XREF_BIBR. S-nitrosylation is a reversible posttranslational modification derived from the interaction of NO with the thiol group of specific cysteines XREF_BIBR. Redox regulation of Ras GTPases occurs in a redox-active cysteine (X) present in a conserved NKXD motif XREF_BIBR. This Cys homologue was identified only in P. brasiliensis Ras1 (Cys123), which was also identified as a putative S-nitrosylation site. GTPases with a redox-sensitive NKCD motif can be activated by NO 2  and other RIs (reactive intermediates). Several cell-based and in vitro studies have shown that NO 2  reacts with Ras through Cys118 to promote nucleotide exchange and Ras activation XREF_BIBR. Raines et al. XREF_BIBR speculated that NO 2 -mediated guanine nucleotide release occurs through a radical propagation mechanism involving Ras thiyl radical conversion to a Ras-GDP guanine radical. The guanine base is particularly sensitive to reaction with free radicals XREF_BIBR and formation of a guanine radical is likely to alter interactions with Ras, resulting in the release of Ras-bound GDP XREF_BIBR. Thus, NO can increase Ras downstream signaling through the mitogen-activated kinase pathway XREF_BIBR.\n\nOn the basis of the above observations, we believe that low levels of NO could lead to Ras S-nitrosylation (probably in residue Cys123), which would lead to exchange of GDP for GTP, and consequent GTPase activation in P. brasiliensis. That would trigger the Ras-dependent downstream cell-signalling pathway. Recently, protein S-nitrosylation has drawn attention as an event capable of inducing biological responses in microorganisms. Seth et al. XREF_BIBR demonstrated that the transcription factor OxyR from E. coli, which is activated by oxidation under aerobic conditions, can also be activated by S-nitrosylation under anaerobic conditions, thus inducing gene expression through alternative PTM.\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that oxidative modifications trigged by H 2 O 2  leads to Ras activation XREF_BIBR, and this radical is involved in Ras signal transduction to the nucleus, mediating Ras-induced cell cycle progression XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. However, the mechanisms by which ROS carries the Ras signal to the nucleus are still unclear.\n\nTesting Ras activity was only possible because of the use of a RBD(Byr2)-GST probe, which detects Ras active form (Ras-GTP). Byr2 from P. brasiliensis (in Pb18 this gene was annotated as a dual-specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase - dSOR1) is also known as Ste11, homologous to mammalian Raf1, and it is a target for regulating Ras XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. In S. pombe, the structure of Ras-Byr2-RBD complex revealed that Byr2-RBD shows essentially the same folding structure as that verified in the RBD of Raf-1 XREF_BIBR. When comparing the Byr2-RBD region of P. brasiliensis with that of S. pombe, we observed that all major amino acid residues that participate in the intermolecular interaction with Ras are preserved (XREF_FIG). We also observed that the residues of interaction with Byr2 corresponding to amino acids Asp33, Glu37, Asp38, Ser39, Arg41 and Asp54, which were detected by Scheffzek et al. XREF_BIBR, are preserved in the Ras1 and Ras2 from P. brasiliensis. Thus, we believe that the Byr2-RBD protein from P. brasiliensis would be able to interact with the activated Ras form (Ras1 and Ras2); that was actually confirmed by pull-down testing. Our probe has become an important tool to verify Ras activity and it may be further used in other conditions and even with other fungal systems.\n\nIn summary, this study demonstrated that in P. brasiliensis low concentrations of ROS and RNS can switch the Ras-GDP for Ras-GTP with consequent activation and triggering of a mitogenic signal transduction. This event is interesting because it has been shown that resistance to ROS and RNS is an important virulence factor in pathogenic fungi. In our model, the fungus used sub-toxic concentrations of ROS and RNS to proliferate. In these conditions, in addition to survive, we believe the fungus would grow and develop within low ROS-producer macrophages. It has been proposed that the intracellular parasitism would be an important event for the establishment and progression of PCM in a susceptible host XREF_BIBR. Thus, a more detailed characterization of these signaling cascades that allow microorganisms to cause disease would be crucial to understand fungal
