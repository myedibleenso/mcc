This property is used in clinical practice for the detection of metastatic tumor mass by positron-emission scanning of 2-[ 18 F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose. It has been widely assumed that cancer cells maintain up-regulated glycolytic metabolism to adapt to the hypoxic conditions in vivo, as solid aggressive tumors overgrow the blood supply of the feeding neovasculature.\n\nEnhanced glycolysis under hypoxic conditions is mediated in part by activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1), which directly regulates most of the glycolytic enzymes (XREF_BIBR). In such a context, the glycolytic response represents a successful metabolic adaptation of cancer cells in vivo. However, the Warburg effect cannot be simply explained by cellular adaptation to hypoxia, as cancer cells maintain enhanced glycolysis even in standard tissue culture conditions (20% oxygen) and in circulating cancers (XREF_BIBR). A more plausible rationalization is that it enables cancer cells to meet their requirements for both energy and metabolic precursors for biosynthesis (XREF_BIBR).\n\nWe recently reported an intriguing relationship between the glycolytic pathway and cellular senescence (XREF_BIBR). All primary somatic cells, with the exception of pluripotent stem cells, have a limited replicative capacity under standard tissue culture conditions and suffer a permanent cell cycle arrest, called replicative senescence (XREF_BIBR). The senescent phenotype can also manifest prematurely, upon exposure to oncogenic mutation (XREF_BIBR), oxidative stress (XREF_BIBR), DNA damage (XREF_BIBR), and secreted cytokines (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; for review see XREF_BIBR). Glycolytic flux declines during senescence in mouse and human primary cells (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), and inhibition of glycolytic flux provokes premature senescence (XREF_BIBR).\n\nA key finding in this regard was the identification of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), the enzyme that converts 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate in the glycolytic pathway, in an unbiased genetic screen for bypass of senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; XREF_BIBR). Conversely, MJE3, a compound identified in a chemical genomics screen for inhibitors of breast cancer cell proliferation, was shown to specifically target PGAM (XREF_BIBR). PGAM activity is up-regulated in many cancerous tissues, including tumors of the lung, colon, liver, and breast (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Indeed, a cancer-specific isoform of pyruvate kinase, designated M2, activates an alternative glycolytic pathway in cancer cells accompanied by dramatic enhancement of PGAM activity (XREF_BIBR). As recent results suggest, the pivotal role of PGAM in coordinating glycolysis and biosynthesis make it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (XREF_BIBR).\n\nDespite our enhanced understanding of how PGAM regulates glycolysis, rather little is known about the regulation of PGAM. PGAM is the only glycolytic enzyme that is not transcriptionally controlled by HIF-1 (XREF_BIBR). Although the muscle-specific form of PGAM can be activated by p53 (XREF_BIBR), there is currently no evidence that PGAM is transcriptionally altered during tumorigenesis. Recent findings instead suggest that PGAM activity is regulated posttranscriptionally. For example, phosphorylation of PGAM by p21 (Cdc42/Rac1)-activated kinase1 (Pak1) results in loss of activity (XREF_BIBR), but the precise mechanism and relevance remains unknown. Here we show that during oncogene-induced senescence or other forms of stress-induced senescence (SIS), Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of PGAM provokes its ubiquitination and turnover. The ubiquitin ligase MDM2, a transcriptional target of p53, binds to and ubiquitinates PGAM in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Of particular note, ubiquitin site mutations in PGAM stabilize the protein and sustain cellular proliferation under stress conditions.\n\n\n\nResults.\n\n\n\nUbiquitin-dependent degradation of PGAM during SIS.\n\nHaving previously shown that PGAM can bypass replicative senescence (XREF_BIBR), we were interested to know what happens to PGAM levels and activity in MEFs undergoing oncogene-induced senescence or SIS. There are two reported isoforms of PGAM--PGAM1 (brain form) and PGAM2 (muscle form)--whose cDNA sequences are 79% and 81% identical in mouse and human cells, respectively. Although the respective homodimers predominate in specific cell types, most normal mouse tissues contain heterodimers of PGAM-1 and -2 (XREF_BIBR). Consistent with this study, we found that the levels of PGAM2 mRNA are almost equivalent to or exceed those of PGAM1 mRNA in some mouse tissues (skin, bone, and lung), whereas PGAM1 mRNA is predominant in others (blood vessel, white adipose tissue, and liver; Fig. S1 A). Moreover, they have similar enzymatic activities and show similar effects on glycolytic flux when overexpressed in MEFs            . We generated polyclonal antiserum against recombinant PGAM2, and although it was affinity-purified using mouse PGAM2 protein, it was found to recognize both isoforms of the mouse and human PGAM proteins               .\n\nTo induce SIS, we exposed primary MEFs to low doses of etoposide (XREF_BIBR) and confirmed that they acquired gamma-H2AX foci and positive staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity            . In this experimental setting, the total level of PGAM protein was greatly reduced, whereas p21 CIP1  increased as expected (XREF_FIG). In contrast, the levels of other glycolytic enzymes, including PFK, PGK, enolase, and GAPDH, remained relatively constant (XREF_FIG). As PGAM1 and PGAM2 mRNA levels also remained constant under these conditions            , the data suggested that PGAM protein levels might be regulated by proteolysis during SIS. In line with this idea, addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored the PGAM protein levels in stressed cells (XREF_FIG). Similar results were obtained in MEFs undergoing Ras-G12V-induced senescence (XREF_FIG). Stress-induced down-regulation of PGAM protein was also observed in human primary fibroblasts (WI-38, TIG3, and IMR90), but not in cancer cell lines (HeLa, 293T, and SW620) that evade SIS                   .\n\nWe previously reported that the PGAM protein can be ubiquitinated (XREF_BIBR), and, consistent with the MG132-sensitive turnover of endogenous PGAM during SIS, a His-tagged ubiquitin purification assay revealed heavy ubiquitination of FLAG-tagged PGAM1 and PGAM2 in primary MEFs exposed to etoposide                          or Ras-G12V                          . Ubiquitination of endogenous PGAM could also be observed in these circumstances by immunoprecipitating PGAM and immunoblotting for ubiquitin (XREF_FIG). Consistently, PGAM enzymatic activity, glycolytic flux, and lactate production were also substantially reduced in the cells exposed to etoposide (XREF_FIG and Fig. S1 M) or RasG12V (XREF_FIG and Fig. S1 N). Collectively, our data suggest that PGAM protein is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation during SIS.\n\n\n\nPak1 phosphorylates PGAM during SIS and provokes premature senescence in primary fibroblasts.\n\nAs ubiquitination often requires prior modification of the target protein (XREF_BIBR), we investigated whether PGAM might be phosphorylated during SIS, specifically by Pak1. It was previously reported that Pak1 physically interacts with and phosphorylates PGAM in immortalized 293T cells, but that PGAM protein levels are not affected by Pak1 activation (XREF_BIBR). However, in contrast to the situation in 293T cells, we found that Pak1 expression in normal WI-38 human fibroblasts caused a substantial reduction in PGAM protein levels (XREF_FIG). A similar effect was seen in primary MEFs but only with wild-type Pak1 and not with a version in which the kinase domain was mutated (XREF_FIG). Importantly, the effects on PGAM protein levels were reflected in reduced PGAM activity, glycolytic flux, and lactate production (XREF_FIG).\n\nConcomitant with reduced PGAM activity, ectopic expression of Pak1 provoked features of senescence, including premature cessation of cell proliferation (XREF_FIG), flattened and enlarged cell morphology, a single large nucleolus, and SA-beta-Gal staining (XREF_FIG). Importantly, the levels of Pak1 protein and mRNA were elevated during SIS resulting from DNA damage (XREF_FIG and Fig. S2 A).\n\nPrevious work identified serines Ser23 and Ser118 as the residues in PGAM1 phosphorylated by Pak1 (XREF_BIBR). As Ser118, but not Ser23, is conserved between PGAM1 and PGAM2, we raised a phospho-specific antibody against a 12-amino acid phosphopeptide centered on Ser118            . Enhanced phosphorylation of Ser118 in PGAM was observed in primary MEFs after treatment with etoposide or expression of Ras-G12V in the presence of MG132 (XREF_FIG and Fig. S2 C). To confirm that Ser118 is a direct target for Pak1 kinase, we prepared recombinant wild-type (PGAM2-WT) or mutant (PGAM-S118C) PGAM2 proteins and deployed them as substrates in an in vitro kinase assay using Pak1 immunopurified from primary MEFs. The ability of Pak1 to phosphorylate wild-type PGAM2 was increased after exposure of the cells to etoposide (XREF_FIG). An equivalent increase was not observed using PGAM-S118C as a substrate, which suggests that stress-induced Pak1 mediates phosphorylation of PGAM at S118 (XREF_FIG).\n\nThese data raised the possibility that phosphorylation of PGAM by Pak1 could promote the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of PGAM during SIS. In support of this notion, PGAM protein levels in Pak1-expressing primary MEFs were restored after MG132 treatment            , and polyubiquitinated forms of PGAM were detected in Pak1-expressing MEFs (XREF_FIG and Fig. S2, E and F).\n\n\n\nPhosphorylation by Pak1 is required for ubiquitination and degradation of PGAM.\n\nNext we examined whether phosphorylation by Pak1 is required for the degradation of PGAM, taking three different approaches. First, we used two different shRNAs against mouse Pak1 to knock down the level of endogenous Pak1 in primary MEFs, as assessed by real-time qRT-PCR and Western blotting (XREF_FIG). Importantly, after ablation of Pak1, the level of endogenous PGAM protein was increased ~1.7-1.9-fold compared with that in control cells (XREF_FIG). Also, the appearance of ubiquitinated forms of PGAM after DNA damage was reduced in Pak1-deficient MEFs (XREF_FIG).\n\nSecond, we asked whether mutation of the Pak1 phosphorylation sites on PGAM restores its stability. Nonphosphorylatable mutants of PGAM2 in which Ser118 was changed to either Cys or Ala (PGAM2-S118C and PGAM2-S118A) were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis. Cotransfection experiments in MEFs revealed that the level of wild-type PGAM, but not of PGAM2-S118C or PGAM2-S118A, was reduced in parallel to the increase of Pak1 expression (XREF_FIG and Fig. S2 G). We determined the stability of the PGAM2-FLAG protein in primary MEFs by blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The level of PGAM2-WT-FLAG rapidly decreased after cycloheximide treatment (XREF_FIG, top left), but was restored by treatment with proteasome inhibitor (XREF_FIG, bottom left). The S118C mutation restored PGAM2 stability by about twofold compared with that of the WT protein (XREF_FIG).\n\nThird, we changed the Ser118 residue to aspartic acid (PGAM-S118D) to mimic the phosphorylated form of PGAM, and examined the effects on stability. In transfected MEFs, under normal culture conditions, the expression of PGAM2-S118D-FLAG was much lower than that of PGAM2-WT-FLAG (XREF_FIG). In this setting, we also noted that PGAM2-S118D-FLAG, but not PGAM2-S118A-FLAG, was highly ubiquitinated            . Collectively, our data indicate that Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of PGAM on Ser118 promotes its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.\n\n\n\nMdm2 mediates PGAM ubiquitination.\n\nAs ubiquitination generally requires a substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase (XREF_BIBR), we next sought to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets PGAM. Having shown that PGAM is vulnerable to ubiquitin-mediated turnover in primary fibroblasts but not in 293T cells (XREF_FIG), we extended these analyses to include additional examples of immortalized cells in order to uncover potentially relevant oncogenic determinants. Using a panel of colon cancer cell lines, we found that PGAM ubiquitination was induced by DNA damage in cells with wild-type p53 (HCT116 and RKO) but not in those with impaired p53 function (HT29 and Sw620; Fig. S3 A; XREF_BIBR). Consistent with the possibility that ubiquitination of PGAM might be p53 dependent, endogenous PGAM levels were down-regulated after tetracycline-induced expression of p53-GFP fusion protein in the TGP53-4 mouse cell line                  , accompanied by a decline in glycolytic flux and lactate production                              . Conversely, the ability of Ras-G12V to induce down-regulation of PGAM in MEFs was abrogated by coexpression of HPV E6, which facilitates p53 degradation            .\n\nAs these data indicate that PGAM is ubiquitinated in a p53-dependent manner, we considered Mdm2 as a likely candidate for the relevant ubiquitin ligase. Mdm2 is both a transcriptional target for p53 and responsible for its ubiquitin-mediated degradation (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Importantly, we did not observe down-regulation of PGAM, glycolytic flux, or lactate production after DNA damage in p53 -/-  or p53 -/- Mdm2 -/-  double knockout (DKO) MEFs (XREF_FIG and Fig. S3 D). However, down-regulation and ubiquitination of PGAM1 and PGAM2 was reinstated after ectopic expression of Myc-Mdm2 in DKO MEFs (XREF_FIG; and Fig. S3 E). This effect was Pak1 dependent, as shRNA-mediated knockdown of Pak1 reduced the turnover of PGAM in Myc-Mdm2-expressing DKO MEFs (XREF_FIG and Fig. S3 F). Moreover, coexpression of Myc-Mdm2 and HA-Pak1 induced PGAM turnover in unstressed DKO MEFs (XREF_FIG). The S118C or S118A mutation restored PGAM2 stability in DKO MEFs coexpressing Myc-Mdm2 and HA-Pak1                   . Collectively, the data imply that Mdm2 has a critical role in Pak1-dependent degradation of PGAM.\n\nTo investigate whether Mdm2 is directly responsible for ubiquitinating PGAM, we first confirmed that the proteins physically interact in the cell. Myc-Mdm2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with both PGAM1 and PGAM2 when the proteins are expressed in DKO MEFs (XREF_FIG). To gain further insights, we constructed a series of deletions and point mutations in PGAM2-FLAG (XREF_FIG, top) and showed that Myc-Mdm2 coprecipitated with full-length PGAM2-FLAG (T1) and with the central one-third of the protein (T4). However, the most robust interaction was with the N-terminally deleted variants of PGAM-FLAG (T2 and TC; XREF_FIG).\n\nRemarkably, the S118D mutation, which mimics S118 phosphorylation, enhanced the binding of full-length PGAM2 to Mdm2 (XREF_FIG), which suggests that Pak1-dependent phosphorylation at S118 promotes the interaction. Moreover, DNA damage facilitated the association between endogenous PGAM and Mdm2 in primary MEFs (XREF_FIG) and also of the ectopically expressed proteins in DKO MEFs (XREF_FIG). Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Pak1 abrogated the physical interactions between Myc-Mdm2 and PGAM-FLAG (XREF_FIG). Based on these results, we concluded that the physical interaction between PGAM and Mdm2 is facilitated by Pak1-dependent phosphorylation after DNA damage.\n\n\n\nMdm2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PGAM in vitro.\n\nAs further confirmation that Mdm2 functions directly as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PGAM, we reconstituted the reaction in vitro using recombinant proteins. Ubiquitination is accomplished by the coordinated actions of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin-ligase (E3). The assays comprised UBE1 as the E1, UbcH5b as the E2 protein, human Mdm2 as the E3 ligase, and PGAM2 as the substrate            , and functionality was confirmed using recombinant p53 protein as a control (XREF_FIG). Although full-length PGAM2 did not appear to be ubiquitinated in vitro as a recombinant protein (XREF_FIG), the central domain (T4) showed strong evidence for monoubiquitination and some degree of polyubiquitination (XREF_FIG). Although the N- and C-terminal domains of PGAM2 (TN and TC, respectively) were not modified, polyubiquitination was clearly observed with the T2 construct, which contains both the central and the C-terminal domains of PGAM2 (XREF_FIG), in line with its more avid binding to Mdm2 (XREF_FIG). Importantly, a catalytically inactive mutant of Mdm2, C464A (XREF_BIBR), did not ubiquitinate PGAM2-T2 in vitro (XREF_FIG), which supports the idea that Mdm2 directly ubiquitinates PGAM.\n\nFull-length PGAM2 contains 20 lysine residues in total (XREF_FIG), seven of which are located in the central domain that appears to be the major target for ubiquitination. Ser118 is also located in this central domain            . Mutated versions of PGAM2 were generated in which either four or seven of the lysine residues flanking Ser118 were changed to arginine (PGAM2-4R and -7R; XREF_FIG and Fig. S4 B). These mutations did not affect the catalytic properties of PGAM2 as judged by its ability to stimulate glycolytic flux and lactate production in primary MEFs            . However, immunoblot analyses indicated that the down-regulation of PGAM by Pak1 in primary MEFs was partially alleviated by the 4R mutation, and completely alleviated by the 7R mutation            . The 7R mutation also restored PGAM catalytic activity, glycolytic flux, and lactate production in Pak1-expressing MEFs            . Strikingly, the 7R mutation rendered PGAM resistant to degradation by DNA damage (XREF_FIG), and completely inhibited PGAM ubiquitination in cultured cells (XREF_FIG and Fig. S4 F) and in vitro (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nStabilization of PGAM restores the proliferative potential of primary fibroblasts under stress conditions.\n\nAlthough Mdm2 is generally considered to be an oncogene, its role is subtle, and ectopic expression of wild-type Mdm2 has been reported to cause cell cycle arrest (XREF_BIBR). Mdm2 contains so-called growth inhibitory domains (ID1 and ID2; XREF_FIG) that are aberrantly spliced out in some human cancers (XREF_BIBR). These observations suggest that in some contexts Mdm2 can function as a tumor suppressor (XREF_BIBR). Interestingly, we noticed that after DNA damage, wild-type MEFs expressing Mdm2 displayed reduced viability compared with control cells (XREF_FIG). A plausible explanation would be that the negative effects of Mdm2 on cell proliferation and viability reflect destabilization of PGAM. In line with this idea, coexpression of PGAM-7R restored cell viability and PGAM activity in Mdm2-expressing wild-type MEFs (XREF_FIG).\n\nAn obvious corollary would be that mutations in Mdm2 that abolish its negative effects on PGAM might be pro-tumorigenic. According to the Catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/), three potentially oncogenic mutations in Mdm2 have been identified: Y281H in glioma and the W329G and M459I mutations in lung carcinoma (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Y281H and W329G are located in the ID2 domain, whereas M459I is located in the RING finger motif that is essential for the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 (XREF_FIG and XREF_BIBR).\n\nWe constructed mammalian expression vectors encoding the three cancer-associated variants of Mdm2, as well as an additional mutation in the catalytic RING finger domain (C464A), and evaluated their effects on both PGAM and p53. As Mdm2 can have an impact on p53 function both catalytically, by promoting its ubiquitination, or noncatalytically, by blocking its transcriptional activation domain (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), we first assessed whether the variant forms of Mdm2 could suppress p53 activity in promoter assays. In the experiment, all four of the Mdm2 variants suppressed p53 activity on the p21 CIP1 , Bax, and Mdm2 promoters to a degree similar to wild-type Mdm2            . In contrast, only the mutations in RING domain (M459I and C464A) abolished the ability of Mdm2 to ubiquitinate p53 in cells and in vitro (XREF_FIG and Fig. S5, B-D). Importantly, when assessed for their effects on PGAM2 stability, in conditions of DNA damage, all of the Mdm2 variants were at least partially impaired, and M459I fully so (XREF_FIG). The impaired ubiquitination of PGAM2 shown by the cancer-associated Mdm2-M459I variant was comparable to that of the Mdm2-C464A mutant            . However, the M459I mutation did not abolish the physical interaction between Mdm2 and either PGAM or p53                   .\n\n\n\nCollaboration between PGAM2, Mdm2, and Ras-G12V in cell transformation.\n\nInterestingly, the Y281H and M459I mutations in Mdm2, in glioma and lung carcinoma, respectively, were accompanied by activating mutations in the G12 residue of Ras (G12D and G12C). We therefore explored whether Ras-G12V and Mdm2 had cooperative effects on the proliferative potential of primary MEFs. Neither wild-type Mdm2 nor any of the three mutants (Y281H, W329G, and M459I) were able to immortalize Ras-G12V-expressing wild-type MEFs, whereas ablation of p53 with HPV E6 readily enabled the cells to bypass Ras-induced senescence (XREF_FIG and Fig. S5 H). However, we obtained a strikingly different answer when these assays were performed using cells derived from a transgenic mouse line that we have developed, in which PGAM2-FLAG expression is driven by the CAG promoter (XREF_BIBR), a fusion between the cytomegalovirus immediate-to-early enhancer element and chicken beta-actin promoters (XREF_FIG). MEFs from the PGAM-Tg mice displayed enhanced glycolytic flux and lactate production            . When we infected the cells with Ras-G12V and the relevant mutants of Mdm2 (WT, Y281H, W329G, and M459I), and passaged them in a 3T3 protocol, the MEFs expressing Ras-G12V and Mdm2-M459I appeared to be immortal and were able to grow as anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar (XREF_FIG). The Mdm2 variants were expressed at equivalent levels shown by Western blotting            . Ubiquitination of PGAM protein was barely detectable in the Ras-G12V/Mdm2-M459I/PGAM-Tg MEFs, compared with the controls or cells transduced with the other Mdm2 mutants (XREF_FIG and Fig. S5 K). Moreover, in the Ras-G12V/Mdm2-M459I/PGAM-Tg MEFs, both glycolytic flux and lactate production were up-regulated (XREF_FIG and Fig. S5 L).\n\nWe previously reported that MEFs expressing PGAM2 and Ras-G12V were unable to grow in soft agar (XREF_BIBR), and, consistent with this observation, we found that Ras-G12V-expressing PGAM2-Tg MEFs could not form tumors in nude mice (XREF_FIG). Of the cells expressing different Mdm2 variants, only the Ras-G12V/Mdm2-M459I/PGAM-Tg MEFs formed tumors in nude mice at a significant frequency (XREF_FIG and XREF_TABLE). We presume that the M459I RING finger mutation renders Mdm2 uniquely able to suppress p53 transactivation without destabilizing PGAM under stress conditions. Thus, in the context of activated Ras-G12V, our data imply that both Mdm2 and the glycolytic enzyme PGAM promote neoplastic transformation (XREF_FIG).\n\n\n\nDiscussion.\n\nWith the notable exception of PGAM, most glycolytic enzymes are transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1alpha (XREF_BIBR) or c-Myc (XREF_BIBR). Here we show that under conditions of DNA damage or oncogenic signaling, each of which provokes premature senescence in primary cells, PGAM is posttranscriptionally regulated through phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. Turnover of PGAM could account for the marked reduction of glycolytic flux observed in senescent cells, and the mechanistic insights we provide suggest a key role for the p53-Mdm2 axis in these events.\n\nThe first step in this process is the activation of Pak1 kinase, a direct downstream effector of Cdc42/Rac1 that is involved in many cellular processes, including cell motility, actin reorganization, gene transcription, and apoptosis, as well as in cancer (XREF_BIBR). Amplification of the Pak1 gene has been observed in human tumors (XREF_BIBR), whereas ectopic expression of Pak1 promotes hyperplasia in vivo (XREF_BIBR) and cellular transformation in vitro (XREF_BIBR). Moreover, mice that lack Merlin, an inhibitor of Pak1, display a cancer-prone phenotype that is exacerbated by p53 mutation (XREF_BIBR). Here we reveal an unexpected role for Pak1 in cellular senescence in primary MEFs and human dermal fibroblasts exposed to various forms of stress. In this respect, the double-edged sword properties of Pak1 are reminiscent of those of oncogenic Ras-G12V, which elicits senescence in primary cells but cell proliferation and transformation in cells that evade senescence (XREF_BIBR).\n\nOur findings also connect Pak1 to the regulation of glycolysis, as its involvement in senescence can be largely explained by its ability to phosphorylate PGAM on Ser118. We present several lines of evidence that in primary cells this event is critical for the subsequent ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated turnover of PGAM. PGAM is stabilized by shRNA-mediated depletion of Pak1 and by mutations that exclude phosphorylation by Pak1, whereas the corresponding phosphomimetic mutation promotes ubiquitination and turnover of PGAM.\n\nAlthough we cannot discount the possibility that other ubiquitin E3 ligases might target PGAM, Mdm2 emerged as an obvious candidate based on the differential behavior of PGAM in p53-positive and -negative cells. We confirmed that phosphorylation of PGAM by Pak1 promotes the interaction between Mdm2 and PGAM under stress conditions, and that Mdm2 ubiquitinates PGAM in cultured cells and in vitro. The in vitro assays identified seven lysine residues in PGAM that are targets for Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination. Consistent with recent reports that ubiquitination sites are generally close to the preceding phosphorylation event (XREF_BIBR), the relevant lysine residues in PGAM are located in the central domain, adjacent to the Pak1-phosphorylation site Ser118.\n\nMdm2 is known to ubiquitinate several other substrates, including the p53 tumor suppressor (XREF_BIBR), and is therefore viewed as an oncogene. In line with this idea, amplification of the Mdm2 gene has been observed in several human cancers (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). It was also reported that the combination of Mdm2, oncogenic Ras-G12V, and adenovirus E1A will efficiently transform human primary fibroblasts (XREF_BIBR). In contrast, we and others have noted that in primary cells, ectopic expression of wild-type Mdm2 induces cell cycle arrest (XREF_BIBR) or apoptosis under conditions of stress (this paper). Moreover, whereas p53 ablation can rescue MEFs from Ras-G12V-induced senescence, ectopic expression of wild-type Mdm2 cannot.\n\nThe differential effects of cancer-associated Mdm2 mutants reveal a plausible explanation. Two of the mutations, Y281H and W329G, in the inhibitory domain 2 (ID2) of Mdm2 partly abolish its ability to ubiquitinate PGAM but not p53. The third mutation, M459I in the RING finger domain, completely abolishes ubiquitin ligase activity both for p53 and PGAM, while remaining able to block p53 transactivation. The relative potency of the Mdm2 mutants in PGAM ubiquitination closely correlated with their abilities to rescue PGAM-Tg MEFs from Ras-induced senescence. Strikingly, the combination of the M459I mutant of Mdm2 and oncogenic Ras-G12V was sufficient to transform primary MEFs from PGAM-Tg mice, but not those from wild-type mice. We suspect that this reflects the higher basal levels of glycolysis and lactate production in the PGAM-Tg, which would facilitate the bypassing of senescence. Collectively, the data suggest that in some contexts, Mdm2 might protect cells from transformation by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated turnover of PGAM. Alternatively, up-regulation of PGAM could promote the oncogenic effects of the mutant forms of Mdm2. Consistent with these ideas, the ubiquitination activity of Mdm2 is reported to be differentially regulated in a cellular context- and developmental stage-dependent manner (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR).\n\nBoth enhanced glycolysis (the Warburg effect) and cellular immortalization are recognized as hallmarks of cancerous tissues and cells. Our data on the ubiquitination of PGAM by the p53/Mdm2 axis during SIS might partly explain how these hallmarks are coupled. The activation of p53 during senescence, whether via DNA damage or direct oncogenic signaling, would potentially down-regulate glycolytic flux by promoting Mdm2-mediated turnover of PGAM. Similar effects on glycolysis would be achieved via the transcriptional activity of p53 on other target genes, such as TIGAR and Glut3 (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Thus, p53 might function as a metabolic checkpoint against tumorigenesis partly by modulating the glycolytic pathway (XREF_BIBR). As we have previously argued (XREF_BIBR), the Warburg effect could represent a metabolic adaptation that enables incipient cancer cells to evade senescence.\n\nSeveral recent studies have emphasized the importance of PGAM as a therapeutic target for cancer management (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Our identification of physiological modulators of PGAM stability might open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n\n\n\n","sentences":[{"words":["Senescence","inducing","stress","promotes","proteolysis","of","phosphoglycerate","mutase","via","ubiquitin","ligase","Mdm2","."],"startOffsets":[0,11,20,27,36,48,51,68,75,79,89,96,100],"endOffsets":[10,19,26,35,47,50,67,74,78,88,95,100,101],"tags":["NN","VBG","NN","VBZ","NN","IN","JJ","NN","IN","NN","NN","NN","."],"lemmas":["senescence","induce","stress","promote","proteolysis","of","phosphoglycerate","mutase","via","ubiquitin","ligase","mdm2","."],"entities":["B-BioProcess","O","O","O","B-BioProcess","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","I-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","B-VP","B-NP","B-VP","B-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":0,"destination":1,"relation":"vmod"},{"source":1,"destination":2,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":3,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":3,"destination":4,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":4,"destination":5,"relation":"prep"},{"source":5,"destination":7,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":7,"destination":6,"relation":"amod"},{"source":7,"destination":8,"relation":"prep"},{"source":8,"destination":11,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":11,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"},{"source":11,"destination":10,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[3]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":0,"destination":1,"relation":"vmod"},{"source":1,"destination":2,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":3,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":3,"destination":4,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":4,"destination":7,"relation":"prep_of"},{"source":7,"destination":6,"relation":"amod"},{"source":7,"destination":11,"relation":"prep_via"},{"source":11,"destination":9,"relation":"nn"},{"source":11,"destination":10,"relation":"nn"}],"roots":[3]}}},{"words":["Mdm2",",","a","ubiquitin","ligase","and","downstream","effector","of","p53",",","attenuates","the","proliferative","potential","of","primary","cells","via","ubiquitination","and","degradation","of","the","glycolytic","enzyme","PGAM","under","senescence","inducing","stress","."],"startOffsets":[105,109,111,113,123,130,134,145,154,157,160,162,173,177,191,201,204,212,218,222,237,241,253,256,260,271,278,283,289,300,309,315],"endOffsets":[109,110,112,122,129,133,144,153,156,160,161,172,176,190,200,203,211,217,221,236,240,252,255,259,270,277,282,288,299,308,315,316],"tags":["NN",",","DT","NN","NN","CC","JJ","NN","IN","NN",",","VBZ","DT","JJ","NN","IN","JJ","NNS","IN","NN","CC","NN","IN","DT","JJ","NN","NN","IN","NN","VBG","NN","."],"lemmas":["mdm2",",","a","ubiquitin","ligase","and","downstream","effector","of","p53",",","attenuate","the","proliferative","potential","of","primary","cell","via","ubiquitination","and","degradation","of","the","glycolytic","enzyme","pgam","under","senescence","induce","stress","."],"entities":["B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","B-Gene_or_gene_product","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","O","B-Family","O","B-BioProcess","O","O","O"],"chunks":["B-NP","O","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","O","B-VP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","I-NP","I-NP","I-NP","B-PP","B-NP","B-VP","B-NP","O"],"graphs":{"stanford-basic":{"edges":[{"source":0,"destination":4,"relation":"appos"},{"source":4,"destination":2,"relation":"det"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":5,"relation":"cc"},{"source":4,"destination":7,"relation":"conj"},{"source":4,"destination":8,"relation":"prep"},{"source":7,"destination":6,"relation":"amod"},{"source":8,"destination":9,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":11,"destination":0,"relation":"nsubj"},{"source":11,"destination":27,"relation":"prep"},{"source":11,"destination":14,"relation":"dobj"},{"source":14,"destination":15,"relation":"prep"},{"source":14,"destination":22,"relation":"prep"},{"source":14,"destination":12,"relation":"det"},{"source":14,"destination":13,"relation":"amod"},{"source":15,"destination":17,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":17,"destination":16,"relation":"amod"},{"source":17,"destination":18,"relation":"prep"},{"source":18,"destination":19,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":19,"destination":20,"relation":"cc"},{"source":19,"destination":21,"relation":"conj"},{"source":22,"destination":26,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":26,"destination":23,"relation":"det"},{"source":26,"destination":24,"relation":"amod"},{"source":26,"destination":25,"relation":"nn"},{"source":27,"destination":28,"relation":"pobj"},{"source":28,"destination":29,"relation":"vmod"},{"source":29,"destination":30,"relation":"dobj"}],"roots":[11]},"stanford-collapsed":{"edges":[{"source":0,"destination":4,"relation":"appos"},{"source":0,"destination":7,"relation":"appos"},{"source":4,"destination":2,"relation":"det"},{"source":4,"destination":3,"relation":"nn"},{"source":4,"destination":7,"relation":"conj_and"},{"source":4,"destination":9,"relati
