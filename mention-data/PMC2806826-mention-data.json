In order to avoid cross-reactions with other Ras isoforms, and using antibodies against K-Ras (R-3400, H3845-M01, sc-30) or pan-Ras (05-516, OP40) in cells that only expressed the K-Ras isoform (fibroblasts obtained from H-ras -/- ,N-ras -/-  mice) we also detected some nuclear positive expression. To further probe the identity of nuclear K-Ras, we have generated K-Ras knockout (K-ras -/- ) embrionary fibroblasts by mating of K-ras +/-  heterozygote mice. Using specific antibodies, only H- and N-Ras isoforms were observed in the cytoplasm of K-ras -/-  fibroblasts. However, both K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B positive signals were detected by immunocytochemistry and Western blot with two commercial antibodies (sc-522 and sc-521 against each isoforms, respectively) in both cytoplasm and nuclei from K-ras -/-  fibroblasts.\n\n\n\nConclusions/Significance.\n\nWe show that the presence of K-Ras4B in fibroblast nuclei, already described by other authors, is probably due to a cross-reaction of the antibody with an undetermined nucleolar protein. Although this study also shows the possible nuclear expression of K-Ras isoform in fibroblasts or in mesangial cells, it also reveals the importance of being cautious in these studies about distribution of protein isoforms due to some important limitations imposed by the unspecificity of the antibodies or contaminations in cellular preparations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\n\nRas proteins control cell growth, proliferation and other aspects of cellular biology including senescence/cell cycle arrest, differentiation and survival, due to their ability to modulate transcription XREF_BIBR. The classical Ras proteins (p21 Ras: H-, K- and N-Ras), together with M-Ras, R-Ras, Rap and Ral, are the prototype members of the Ras subfamily that is included in the Ras superfamily of small monomeric GTP-binding (G) proteins; this superfamily also includes the Rho, Ran, Rab, Rac, Rheb, Arf and Kir/ReM/Ras subfamilies XREF_BIBR. p21 Ras proteins include three closely related members with a molecular mass of ~21 KDa: H-Ras (or Ha-Ras), K-Ras (or Ki-Ras) and N-Ras. K-Ras occurs in two alternatively spliced forms: Ki(A)-Ras (or K-Ras4A) and Ki(B)-Ras (or K-Ras4B), deriving from Kras-2 gene expression XREF_BIBR. In mammals, these three functional ras genes are ubiquitously expressed in all organs and located in different chromosomes XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR but expression levels may vary between different cell types.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest the existence of unique roles for the three mammalian ras genes; gene targeting experiments have demonstrated that neither H-Ras nor N-Ras function are essential in the mouse: N-ras homozygous mutant mice grow normally XREF_BIBR. In addition, disruption of H-Ras and N-Ras, individually or in combination, reveals dispensability of both loci for mouse growth and development XREF_BIBR. In contrast, embryos homozygous for a mutation in K-ras die between 12 and 14 days of gestation, with foetal liver defects and evidence of anaemia XREF_BIBR. Thus, K-ras is the only member of the ras gene family essential for mouse embryogenesis XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR.\n\nSignal transduction down the Ras pathway has been generally considered to initiate at the plasma membrane. It is now clear that the plasma membrane does not represent the only platform for Ras signalling: genetically encoded fluorescent probes have revealed signalling on a variety of intracellular membranes, included the Golgi apparatus XREF_BIBR. Thus, the members of the Ras family of proteins are considered cytoplasmic proteins that must be localized to the plasma or other intracellular membranes for activation, but there are only two studies showing the nuclear presence of Ras isoforms XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Birchenall-Roberts et al. XREF_BIBR has been the first and only group to describe the presence of K-Ras4B isoform in fibroblast nuclei.\n\nIn order to study the cellular distribution of the K-Ras isoform and its possible function, we have generated K-Ras knock-out (K-ras -/- ) embrionary fibroblasts by culturing K-ras -/-  embryos obtained from mating of K-Ras heterocygous mice (K-ras +/- ). We have also analyzed K-Ras cellular distribution in H-ras -/- /N-ras -/-  fibroblasts, which only express the K-Ras isoform. In this study we show the putative presence of K-Ras isoforms in nuclei of human mesangial cells and fibroblasts from H-ras -/- /N-ras -/-  mice, whereas H- and N-Ras isoforms were absent. We hypothesize that the detection of the K-Ras4B isoform in nuclei of human fibroblasts previously described by Birchenall-Roberts et al. XREF_BIBR is probably due to cross-reaction of the antibody used against K-Ras4B since we observed cytoplasmic and nuclear staining in K-ras -/-  embrionary fibroblasts using the same antibody. This experimental work puts forward the need to be careful as well as provides useful information about antibodies specificity in studies about Ras isoforms.\n\n\n\nResults and Discussion.\n\nCellular distribution of Ras isoforms was examined by immunofluorescence analysis in a confocal microscope. H-, N- and K-Ras isoforms are expressed in the plasma and intracellular membranes of human mesangial cells, but nuclei from these cells also showed positive staining for K-Ras4B isoform appearing as dense aggregates using the sc-521 antibody, which is supposedly specific for K-Ras4B isoforms (XREF_FIG). K-Ras4A staining detected with sc-522 antibody was fainter than K-Ras4B expression, accordingly with the fact that K-Ras4B is the predominant splice variant XREF_BIBR.\n\nTo exclude the possibility of cross-reaction between anti-K-Ras and other Ras isoforms, we assessed the expression of Ras isoforms in fibroblasts from H-ras -/- /N-ras -/-  mice using the same antibodies. Our results confirmed the lack of H- and N-Ras isoforms, the presence of K-Ras4A distributed along the plasma membrane and the expression of K-Ras4B in plasma membrane and nuclei; these results confirm that the pattern of expression observed in mesangial and fibroblast nuclei supposedly corresponded to K-Ras (XREF_FIG).\n\nThe next step in our study was to reproduce the same set of experiments in K-Ras KO fibroblasts. The absence of K-Ras expression in K-ras -/-  fibroblasts, as well as the only expression of K-Ras in H-ras -/- /N-ras -/-  fibroblasts was confirmed by PCR and western blot analysis. XREF_FIG shows genotypic characterization and H-, N-, K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B isoforms expression in Kras -/-  (XREF_FIG) and H-ras -/- /N-ras -/-  fibroblasts (XREF_FIG) by DNA and RNA PCR and Western blot. The immunofluorescence analysis showed the appearance of H-Ras, N-Ras and both K-Ras isoforms in the plasma membranes and K-Ras4B immunostaining in nuclei of wild type (XREF_FIG) and, surprisingly, in nuclei of K-ras -/-  fibroblasts (XREF_FIG), with the same pattern of what was supposed to be K-Ras4B staining that we previously observed in H-ras -/- /N-ras -/-  fibroblasts and human mesangial cells. The sc-522 antibody against K-Ras4A also showed a fainter positive staining in both membranes and nuclei from K-ras -/-  fibroblasts (XREF_FIG). Thus, our data clearly demonstrates that sc-521 and sc-522 antibodies do not specifically recognize K-Ras isoforms. K-Ras4B expression was detected by western blot in nuclei from human mesangial cells using the sc-521 antibody. Moreover, three different antibodies directed against K-Ras proteins (H3845-M01, sc-521, sc-522) detected K-Ras4B expression in nuclear extracts from K-ras -/-  fibroblasts (XREF_FIG). However, other antibody directed against K-Ras (R3400, Sigma) detected its expression in nuclear fractions by western blot (XREF_FIG). On the other hand, the sc-521 antibody directed against K-Ras4B showed a faint signal in cytosolic and nuclear extracts from K-ras +/+  fibroblasts but it did not show a positive signal by immunoblot in nuclear extracts from K-ras -/-  fibroblasts (XREF_FIG). Moreover, the sc-522 antibody against K-Ras4A showed a positive signal in the cytosolic fraction from K-ras -/-  fibroblasts (as we previously observed by immunostaining). Unfortunately, the antibodies which were suitable for immunofluorescence analysis did not show a good signal when used for immunobloting, and the appropriate antibodies for western blot detection were useless to perform immunofluorescence studies.\n\nTubulin, cyclin A and histone H1 expression were used as controls to identify the purity of cytoplasmic and nuclear preparations, respectively. However, it is almost unfeasible the complete isolation and purification of nuclear fractions, considering the continuous nature of the nuclear envelope with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and taking into account that 4-6% of these nuclear fractions are cytoplasmic contaminations (mainly ER) which are frequently stuck to the external nuclear membrane, as it was early described by Puddington et al. XREF_BIBR. Moreover, most of the recent studies in the literature do not show controls for ER contamination in their nuclear fraction. Even the isolation of nuclear fractions by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation showed similar results than with the CelLytic Nuclear Extraction Kit, and traces of cytoplasmic contamination may be present (although in the nuclear fractions there was almost no expression of tubulin, which was used as purity control). Thus, it may well be that the nuclear fractions had some contamination with ER-associated proteins, attributing to the nucleus some Ras isoforms present in the ER XREF_BIBR.\n\nFinally, we evaluated by ELISA whether the presumed nuclear K-Ras was able to bind Raf-RBD, Ras binding domain (active state) or not (inactive state). Whereas Ras bound to Raf-RBD is detected in cytoplasmic fractions (18.15+/-0.92 luminescence arbitrary units (LAU) vs. 7.38+/-0.74 LAU corresponding to the blank samples), our data shows that Ras is not bound to Raf-RBD in nuclear extracts from human mesangial cells as LAU were similar to those of the blank samples. In order to discard that Ras activity was not detectable in nuclear extracts because of the inactivity of this putative nuclear K-Ras, we also evaluated the presence of nuclear active Ras in the tumoral cell line HeLa, which express constitutively-active Ras. A small amount of Ras bound to Raf-RBD was detected in HeLa nuclear extracts (12.49+/-1.27 LAU vs. 17.32+/-2.42 LAU in HeLa cytoplasmic fractions), but this detection is probably due to endoplasmic reticulum contamination in the nuclear fractions. As a positive control we used an extract of EGF-treated HeLa cells, and this extract gives values over 32.78+/-2.21 LAU. Thus, we may suggest that if any Ras isoform is present in mesangial cells nuclei, this putative nuclear Ras is not able to bind Raf.\n\nAlthough it has been suggested that the C-terminus of K-Ras4B acts as a nuclear localization signal XREF_BIBR, there are only two studies in the literature showing the presence of any Ras isoform in nuclei of eukaryotic cells. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies identified overexpressed H-Ras and Rap-1 in or around nuclei of transformed cells XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, although the functional significance of these findings is unknown. RRP22, a Ras-related protein, was found in the nucleolus XREF_BIBR, and recently, Birchenall-Roberts et al. XREF_BIBR, using confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis, showed K-Ras4B staining in the nucleoli of human fibroblasts suggesting a physical and functional association between K-Ras4B and nucleolin, a pleiotropic regulator of cellular processes. However, in the present study we have demonstrated that the antibodies used by Birchenall-Roberts et al. (sc-521 and sc-522) do not specifically recognize K-Ras proteins as they produce a clear immunostaining in K-ras -/-  fibroblasts.\n\nThus, our study in K-Ras KO fibroblasts, as well as in fibroblasts that only expressed the K-Ras isoform, shows that there are no definitive evidences confirming the expression of K-Ras proteins in the nuclei of fibroblasts, because the only study published at the moment has been performed with an antibody that does not recognize specifically the K-Ras4B isoform. K-Ras in nuclei, if present, should be in its inactive form (not attached to Raf-RBD). The confirmation of the presence of nuclear forms of K-Ras is such an important finding for eukaryotic cells that makes necessary to be cautious and control exhaustively all experimental
