Attenuation of TGF-beta signaling is found to cause metastatic progression of Ras-transformed HMECs.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed neoplasm in American women and the leading cause of cancer death among nonsmoking females (XREF_BIBR). Treating malignant breast cancer continues to be a challenge to medical professionals because our knowledge of multifaceted molecular alterations that drive breast carcinogenesis is still quite limited. Gene expression profiling studies revealed that different phenotypes of breast carcinomas could be classified with distinctive gene expression profiles. For example, triple-negative breast carcinomas (estrogen receptor negative [ER-], progesterone receptor negative [PR-], EGFR2/Her2 negative [Her2-]), which often have a poor prognosis, have a basal-like gene expression profile similar to that of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, little is known about the molecular alterations that cause basal-like breast cancer. Unlike ER+ or Her2+ breast carcinomas, there are only few targets for the treatment or prevention of basal-like breast carcinomas, which are highly prevalent in African American women (XREF_BIBR).\n\nTransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling is known to suppress epithelial tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell cycle progression, stimulating apoptosis, and promoting genomic stability and cellular senescence (XREF_BIBR). In humans and mice, TGF-beta is a homodimeric polypeptide of 25 kDa. Three TGF-beta isoforms, termed TGF-beta1, beta2, and beta3, have been identified in mammals. Secreted TGF-beta binds to two different cell surface receptors called type I (RI) and type II (RII) receptors. They are serine/threonine kinase receptors, which also contain the tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of TGF-beta to RII leads to the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of RI. The activated RI phosphorylates intracellular Smad2 and Smad3, which then interact with Smad4 protein to form an oligomeric complex. Once transported into nuclei, the Smad2/Smad3/Smad4 complex binds to specific DNA sequences and they act as transcription activators or repressors, depending on DNA sequence and cellular context (XREF_BIBR).\n\nTGF-beta signaling components have been shown to be mutated in certain types of carcinomas and attenuated in many others. In human breast cancer, mutational inactivation of TGF-beta receptors or its intracellular signal transducers--Smad proteins--is rare (XREF_BIBR). However, reduced expression of RII has been associated with tumor progression (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). To our knowledge, how the impaired TGF-beta receptor signaling alters genome-wide transcription profile resulting in oncogene-induced transformation and malignant progression in HMECs has not been clearly described. On the other hand, blockade of TGF-beta signaling with the expression of a transgenic dominant-negative RII (DNRII) or deletion of RII gene only increased cell proliferation, with no evidence of tumorigenesis in mammary gland, pancreas, and epidermis in mice (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), suggesting that the attenuation of TGF-beta signaling alone appears insufficient for transformation.\n\nOncogenes, such as H-Ras-V12, are known to induce premature senescence in murine fibroblasts and HMECs in vitro by activating p16ink4a/Rb and p53 pathways (XREF_BIBR). More recently, several studies have reported senescence-like phenotypes (SLPs) in early stages of neoplasm in various human and mouse tissues, including breast tumors (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, many breast cancer cells and tissues show gene signature expression profiles resembling Ras activation (XREF_BIBR). In addition, oncogenic Ras has been shown to cooperate with mutant p53 to switch TGF-beta to be a tumor promoter in enhancing the progression of breast cancer (XREF_BIBR). Thus, bypassing oncogene-induced SLP appears to be a limiting step for tumorigenesis. Significantly, attenuation of TGF-beta signaling in mouse keratinocytes was shown to overcome H-Ras-V12-induced premature senescence (XREF_BIBR). However, the biology of mouse keratinocytes may not be the same as that of HMECs, and how attenuation of TGF-beta signaling can suppress SLP and facilitate malignant transformation by an oncogene in HMECs has not been studied. Given that HMEC resembles basal-like estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer and is an appropriate model for the study of basal-like breast cancer, we used it to elucidate how the attenuation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling serves as a key step in leading to oncogenic transformation and metastatic progression upon expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and H-Ras-V12.\n\nWe generated a series of isogenic HMECs representing a full spectrum of basal-like breast carcinogenesis to identify candidate genes that mediate the escape of oncogene-induced senescence and malignant transformation of basal-like breast cancer. We found that autocrine TGF-beta signaling is an integral part of cellular antitransformation network by suppressing the expression of a host of genes, including p21-regulated genes that mediate oncogene-induced transformation. Our study shows that abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling can promote malignant progression of H-Ras-V12-transformed HMECs in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Our novel finding modifies the current dogma that TGF-beta inhibits breast carcinogenesis by simply inhibiting cell proliferation and provides novel insights into the mechanism of the cross-talk between the TGF-beta signaling and oncogenic Ras signaling in basal-like breast cancer development and progression.\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\n\nTGF-beta signaling is attenuated in human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines.\n\nReduced expression of RII and Smad4 in human breast tissues has been associated with breast tumorigenesis and progression (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Many breast cancer cell lines are also known to express low levels of RII (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). As a result, they are often resistant to the growth-inhibitory activity of TGF-beta. We found that, in contrast to the untransformed MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells, many triple-negative human breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, BT20, Hs578T, HCC1937, and HCC3153, are resistant to the growth-inhibitory activity of TGF-beta (XREF_FIG). Thus the attenuation of TGF-beta signaling is likely a hallmark of breast tumorigenesis in some triple-negative breast cancer patients.\n\n\n\nGeneration of hTERT-immortalized HMEC/DNRII cells.\n\nBecause HMECs from primary cultures are considered appropriate models for studying triple-negative basal-like breast cancer (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), we immortalized HMECs with the hTERT as previously done by others (XREF_BIBR) and used the immortalized HMECs to determine the role of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in breast carcinogenesis. To mimic the attenuated TGF-beta signaling in breast cancer cell lines and tissues, we stably introduced a dominant-negative TGF-beta RII (DNRII) into the immortalized HMECs as shown in XREF_FIG. Control cells were transfected with an empty vector. The expression of DNRII significantly attenuated TGF-beta receptor signal transduction as reflected by a reduction of basal phosphorylated Smad2 (P-Smad2) and fibronectin (FN) and a more pronounced reduction of TGF-beta-stimulated P-Smad2 and FN levels in the DNRII cells (XREF_FIG). DNRII expression also significantly reduced basal as well as TGF-beta-stimulated Smad-responsive promoter activity, as shown in XREF_FIG. Because HMECs were cultured in a serum-free (consequently TGF-beta-free) medium, the change of basal gene expression and promoter activity due to DNRII expression indicated that DNRII attenuated autocrine TGF-beta signaling. Although DNRII expression only partially blocked TGF-beta-induced P-Smad2 and TGF-beta-responsive promoter activity (XREF_FIG), DNRII cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory activity of TGF-beta, as shown in XREF_FIG. Thus DNRII cells show similar TGF-beta responsive properties shared by triple-negative breast cancer cells, as shown in XREF_FIG.\n\n\n\nBlockade of TGF-beta signaling inhibits H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA in HMECs.\n\nBecause many breast cancer cells exhibit enhanced signature pathways resembling Ras activation (XREF_BIBR), we transfected HMEC control and DNRII cells with the oncogenic H-Ras-V12 in an attempt to generate transformed cell lines. Of interest, expression of H-Ras-V12 in the control cells induced senescence-like phenotypes (SLPs) such as the expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal; XREF_BIBR; XREF_FIG), enlarged cell shape, and cessation of cell proliferation, with a reduced level of phosphorylated Rb (P-Rb) protein in comparison with DNRII + Ras cell (XREF_FIG). Similar to the effect of DNRII, treatment of the control HMECs with an RI kinase inhibitor (RIKI, LY-364947) also prevented Ras-induced SLP, whereas removal of RIKI after Ras expression restored SLP (XREF_FIG). Although HMECs, like many breast cancer cell lines, do not express a detectable level of p16ink4a due to methylation-mediated silencing of its promoter (XREF_BIBR), and increased expression of p16ink4a is believed to be necessary for the maintenance of H-Ras-V12-induced senescence in normal human fibroblasts (XREF_BIBR), we found that the H-Ras-V12-induced senescence-like phenotypes were quite stable since only a few cells out of thousands of growth-arrested cells occasionally escaped from the arrest after several weeks of culture. However, to distinguish p16ink4a-mediated senescence from the senescence-like phenotypes in HMEC/Ras cells, we use the term senescence-like growth arrest (SLGA) for the latter.\n\n\n\nH-Ras-V12 HMEC clones spontaneously escape from SLGA without increasing active autocrine TGF-beta.\n\nTo obtain HMECs spontaneously recovered from H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA, we plated senescence-like HMEC Ras cells in soft agarose and isolated a few colonies. These Ras clones were found to be transformed, since they could form colonies when replated in soft agarose (unpublished data). They retained high expression of the transfected Ras when compared with growth-arrested control + Ras cells (called Ras-SLGA hereafter) and DNRII + Ras cells, as shown for one of the Ras clones, called Ras cl.4 hereafter, in XREF_FIG. Ras cl.4 also contained the active H-Ras-V12, since it expressed increased levels of the phosphorylated Erk and Akt, similar to those in DNRII + Ras and Ras-SLGA (XREF_FIG). Of interest, Ras cl.4 was less sensitive to the growth-inhibitory activity of TGF-beta than the control HMECs, suggesting dysregulation of TGF-beta growth-inhibitory pathway by the oncogenic Ras (XREF_FIG). However, Ras cl.4 and Ras cl.1, one of other Ras clones that escaped from H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA, were fully responsive to the transcriptional activity of TGF-beta (XREF_FIG). Previous study showed that H-Ras-V12 expression drastically increased total and active TGF-beta1 secretion into the medium conditioned by mouse keratinocytes (XREF_BIBR), which should significantly increase autocrine TGF-beta activity. We found, in fact, that the total TGF-beta1 level in the medium conditioned by the control cells was below the detection limit of 15 pg/ml (XREF_FIG, N.D.). Although H-Ras-V12 expression significantly increased total TGF-beta1 in the conditioned media of DNRII + Ras and Ras cl.4 cells (XREF_FIG), this level was still considerably (~10 times) lower than what was reported for the Ras-transfected mouse keratinocytes. In addition, the active form of TGF-beta1 in the media conditioned by Ras-transfected HMECs was undetectable. On the other hand, HMECs produced readily detectable levels of active TGF-beta2. However, neither the total TGF-beta2 (unpublished data) nor the active TGF-beta2 was increased by H-Ras-V12 expression (XREF_FIG). This indicates that H-Ras-V12 expression does not increase the autocrine TGF-beta activity in the HMECs. It should be noted that we have previously showed that the triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells also produce significantly higher TGF-beta2 than TGF-beta1 (XREF_BIBR).\n\n\n\nBlockage of TGF-beta signaling enhances oncogenic Ras-induced tumorigenesis and metastasis.\n\nBecause the abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling with DNRII expression overcame H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA, we next compared the tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of DNRII + Ras cells with Ras clones in female nude mice. We found orthotopic injection of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled DNRII + Ras cells mixed with Matrigel produced larger orthotopic tumors than EGFP-labeled Ras clones mixed with Matrigel with 100% incidence (XREF_FIG). By using green fluorescence imaging to detect micrometastases in excised lungs, we found that all mice inoculated with DNRII + Ras cells had more and larger lung metastasis colonies than the mice inoculated with Ras cl.1 (XREF_FIG). Because orthotopically inoculated Ras cl.4 formed very small tumors and thus did not metastasize to lung (XREF_FIG), we also injected DNRII + Ras and Ras cl.4 cells in the tail vein to compare their metastatic potential. Although the mice injected with Ras cl.4 showed some lung metastasis colonies, those injected with DNRII + Ras had many more lung metastasis colonies (XREF_FIG). As such, while Ras clones are transformed, they are much less malignant than DNRII + Ras cells, thus representing early neoplastic cells. On the other hand, the DNRII + Ras cell-formed tumors showed similar features as basal-like breast cancer, such as a high frequency of visceral metastasis. To further demonstrate that our models derived from HMEC cells indeed reflected the triple-negative breast cancer process, we confirmed that the tumors derived from Ras cl.4 and DNRII + Ras cells were ER-negative (XREF_FIG). We also found that some DNRII + Ras cell-formed tumors contained necrotic foci and squamous metaplasia (XREF_FIG) and did not metastasize to bone even when the cells were inoculated in the arterial circulation (unpublished data). These are also the reported features of basal-like breast cancer (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). Thus the metastatic potential of DNRII + Ras cells appears to correlate with that of late-stage basal-like breast cancer cells.\n\n\n\nGenome-wide transcript profiles of a series of isogenic basal-like HMEC lines.\n\nTo find the gene signature that contributes to SLGA by H-Ras-V12, the escape from SLGA, tumorigenesis, and metastasis, we performed gene expression microarray using Affymetrix HG-U133_Plus_2 chips containing 54,743 probes for the human genome. Of interest, many previously identified genes related to breast cancer metastasis, poor prognosis, and basal-like markers in clinical samples (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR) were found to be highly up-regulated in DNRII + Ras cells when compared with the control cell (Supplemental Table S1), again demonstrating the clinical relevance of our model systems. Because of the multiple cell lines with different properties in senescence and malignancy used in our gene expression profiling, we were able to perform combinatorial/clustering analyses across various comparisons. For example, by asking what genes are up-regulated in the cells that escaped SLGA and are also up-regulated by the blockade of autocrine TGF-beta signaling, we pulled out the genes that are up-regulated in Ras cl.4 versus Ras-SLGA, DNRII + Ras versus Ras-SLGA, and DNRII versus control. Of interest, many genes that are involved in the regulation of mitosis and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints were among the most highly increased genes, as listed in XREF_TABLE. The changes of AURKB, CDC2, and STK6/AURA transcripts in XREF_TABLE were confirmed with real time (RT)-PCR (Supplemental Figure S1).\n\n\n\nAbrogation of autocrine TGF-beta overcame H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA with a significant reduction of p21 level and transcriptional activity of p53.\n\nOne gene worth noting from our microarray data is p21. p21 is known to be stimulated by TGF-beta in a p53-independent manner (XREF_BIBR), and its transcript was down-regulated by 30% in DNRII cells in comparison with the control according to our microarray analysis (XREF_FIG). Of interest, it was more significantly down-regulated in DNRII + Ras and Ras cl.4 cells. The down-regulation of p21 transcript also resulted in decreased p21 protein levels, as shown with the Western blotting (XREF_FIG). In fact, p21 protein was undetectable in both Ras cl.4 and Ras cl.1, and its levels were not correlated with p53 levels (XREF_FIG). Similar to the effect of DNRII, treatment of HMECs with the RIKI also reduced p21 protein level by 48% (XREF_FIG) and led to the suppression of Ras-induced SLGA (XREF_FIG).\n\nIn addition to Ras cl.4 and Ras cl.1, we also screened two additional Ras clones that escaped from H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA for their expression of p53 and p21. Treatment of the cells with the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C (Mit C) induced p53 expression in all cells except Ras cl.3 (XREF_FIG). Ras cl.3 has a high basal level of p53, suggesting that it may have a mutated p53. Whereas p53 was up-regulated by Mit C in other Ras clones, p21 was not detectable in Ras cl.4 and Ras cl.1 as expected, and was not regulated by p53 in Ras cl.2. Of interest, p21 could still be stimulated by TGF-beta in Ras cl.2, as shown in XREF_FIG. Thus the escape from H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA is associated with loss of p21 regulation by p53 in these Ras clones. On the other hand, abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta overcame H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA, with a significant reduction of p21 level (XREF_FIG) and apparent attenuation of p53-induced p21 expression in DNRII + Ras cells, as shown in XREF_FIG.\n\nBecause the ability of Mit C-induced p53 to increase p21 expression is attenuated in DNRII HMECs in comparison to the control (XREF_FIG), we further determined whether p53 activity was decreased by the abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in DNRII HMECs. We transiently cotransfected a beta-gal expression plasmid with a p53-responsive p21 promoter-luciferase or a PCNA promoter-luciferase reporter into the control and DNRII HMECs. The cells were then treated with Mit C to induce DNA damage and p53 expression. Treatment with Mit C increased a similar level of p53 in the control, DNRII, and DNRII + Ras cells, as shown in XREF_FIG. It significantly stimulated the luciferase activity in the control cells. However, the stimulation was attenuated in DNRII cells for both promoters (XREF_FIG). Site-directed mutation of the p53-responsive element in the PCNA promoter abolished the effect of Mit C treatment (unpublished data), suggesting that the Mit C-induced promoter activity was due to increased transcriptional activity of p53. Next we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine whether the amount of p53 bound to p53-responsive promoters was inhibited by the abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling among the control, DNRII, and DNRII + Ras HMECs. As shown in XREF_FIG, the treatment with Mit C significantly stimulated the occupancy of p53 at the two p53-responsive promoters of p21 and MDM2 but not at the negative control promoter of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in the control cells. In contrast, p53 occupancy at p21 and MDM2 promoters was significantly attenuated in the DNRII and DNRII + Ras cells. These data, together with the data shown in XREF_FIG, indicate that p53 activity is partially inhibited by the blockade of TGF-beta signaling.\n\n\n\nA high level of p21 expression is necessary for H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA.\n\np21 is known to be transiently stimulated in a p53-dependent manner during DNA damage response or the induction of premature senescence by H-Ras-V12 in fibroblasts and is believed to be responsible for the initial cell cycle arrest (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). We also observed the transient changes of p53 and p21 when H-Ras-V12 was expressed in HMECs (XREF_FIG). Of interest, both p53 and p21 levels started to rise 2 d after the infection by H-Ras-V12 retrovirus, when H-Ras level was not noticeably increased. This could be due to our inability to detect a subtle H-Ras increase at day 2, since phosphorylated Erk proteins were significantly increased due to H-Ras-V12 transfection (XREF_FIG). A significant increase of H-Ras-V12 expression was observed on days 6 and 8, when the cells started to exhibit SLGA and p21 levels started to return to the level of the control cell (as at day 0).\n\nPublished studies have shown that deletion of p21 gene is not sufficient for mouse fibroblasts to bypass Ras-induced senescence (XREF_BIBR) but is sufficient for the transformation of mouse keratinocytes by Ras (XREF_BIBR). Because abrogation of TGF-beta signaling with DNRII expression or RIKI treatment resulted in a modest reduction (30-50%) of p21 (XREF_FIG), induction of many p21-inhibited genes (XREF_TABLE), and suppression of H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA (XREF_FIG), we hypothesized that a modest reduction of p21 may be sufficient to alter the expression of many genes and consequently suppress H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA in HMECs. Therefore we stably infected HMECs with a p21 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing retrovirus, which resulted in a modest (35-50%) reduction of endogenous p21 level (XREF_FIG). Of interest, the expression of H-Ras-V12 in the p21 shRNA-expressing cells did not induce SLGA, whereas it did induce SLGA in the control cells, as expected (XREF_FIG). Thus our data demonstrate that a modest down-regulation of p21 is sufficient for the escape of Ras-induced SLGA, suggesting that p21 is a major mediator for the regulation of Ras-induced SLGA by autocrine TGF-beta signaling.\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nTriple-negative, basal-like breast cancer is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms that drive its progression are not well understood, and few molecular targets have been identified for its prevention or treatment. Our study demonstrates that triple-negative human breast cancer cell lines show attenuated TGF-beta signaling. Therefore we generated a series of isogenic HMECs with altered TGF-beta sensitivity and different malignancy, representing a full spectrum of basal-like breast carcinogenesis. To identify candidate genes that may mediate the escape of H-Ras-V12-induced premature senescence and the oncogene-induced transformation of the basal-like HMECs when TGF-beta signaling is attenuated, we determined gene expression profiles of five HMEC lines: control, DNRII, DNRII + H-Ras-V12 (named DNRII + Ras, which was spontaneously metastatic), H-Ras-V12 pool (named Ras-SLGA, which was senescent), and an H-Ras-V12 clone (named Ras cl.4, which escaped from SLGA and was weakly tumorigenic). Our study indeed identifies the molecular pathways and networks involved in the development and progression of the basal-like breast cancer, as well as the potential utility of targeting TGF-beta pathway for the inhibition of metastasis induced by triple-negative basal-like breast cancer cells.\n\nIn our study, we found that abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling with the expression of a DNRII or the use of RIKI in telomerase-immortalized HMECs suppressed H-Ras-V12-induced SLGA. TGF-beta-mediated regulation of oncogene-induced premature senescence likely involves multiple pathways, which may depend on cellular context. For example, in mouse keratinocytes, oncogenic Ras expression significantly induced the production of active TGF-beta1, which led to the inhibition of c-Myc and the stimulation of p15ink4b, resulting in senescence. Of interest, p21 was not regulated by exogenous and autocrine TGF-beta in the mouse keratinocytes (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). In contrast, the HMECs we used produce very little total TGF-beta1 and do not produce a detectable level of active TGF-beta1 even after Ras expression. After we found that the expression of DNRII or the use of RIKI could suppress Ras-induced senescence in HMECs, we performed an extensive gene microarray in five isogenic HMEC lines and Western blots to search for the alteration of cell cycle regulatory genes and TGF-beta target genes such as p21, p15, and c-Myc that may be responsible for DNRII-induced escape from senescence. p21 was found to be moderately reduced in DNRII HMECs and dysregulated in various Ras-expressing clones, but not p15 and c-Myc. To address whether a moderate reduction of p21 in DNRII HMECs was sufficient to suppress Ras-induced SLGA, we knocked down p21, which showed that a moderate reduction of p21 was sufficient to evade Ras-induced SLGA. Thus our results indicate that, whereas TGF-beta signaling is necessary for the induction of SLGA by Ras in both mouse keratinocytes and HMECs, the molecular pathways that mediate TGF-beta-regulated SLGA are very different between the two cells.\n\nRecently it was shown that the Smad4 inactivation in mouse prostate epithelium with Pten loss can bypass the oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and enhance tumor cell proliferation and metastasis when compared with the mouse prostate with only Pten loss, indicating that TGF-beta/Smad4 signaling as a barrier can inhibit prostate cancer progressing from intraepithelial neoplasia to highly metastatic adenocarcinoma (XREF_BIBR). In addition, it was reported that TGF-beta-inhibited miR-200 has a biphasic role in mediating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition during different stages of metastasis. In particular, elevated miR-200 expression is required to efficiently promote metastatic colonization of breast cancer (XREF_BIBR), which may be due to the attenuated TGF-beta signaling. Therefore, our study, together with those findings, provides novel insight into how reduced TGF-beta signaling can drive metastatic tumor progression by attenuating OIS, SLGA, or other cues.\n\np21 is well known as a broad-specificity inhibitor of cyclin/CDK complexes and to induce SLGA in a p53-dependent manner when a cell is exposed to DNA-damaging agents, ionizing radiation, or oncogenes such as H-Ras-V12. p21 plays a key role in mediating TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest in a p53-independent manner (XREF_BIBR). p21 is known to inhibit E2F activity by inhibiting CDKs and has been shown to regulate a host of gene transcription, primarily via its effect on E2F (XREF_BIBR). Ectopic expression of p21 was shown to reduce transcripts of many genes involved in mitosis, including CDC2, cyclin B, and CENPA, which are also identified in our microarray analysis, suggesting that the altered transcription of some genes shown in XREF_TABLE might primarily be due to altered p21 expression and might have contributed to the escape from SLGA.\n\nIt is well known that inactivation of p53 is necessary for the escape from SLGA and for malignant transformation induced by DNA damage or oncogenic signals in various types of cells, including HMECs (XREF_BIBR). Thus the malignant transformation by the abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling and H-Ras-V12 expression may also involve partial inactivation of p53. Indeed, we found that the ability of mitomycin C-induced p53 to increase p21 expression was attenuated in DNRII HMECs in comparison to the control, and p53 transcriptional activity was decreased by the abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in DNRII HMECs as well. p53 has been shown to interact with Smad2 and enhance the transcriptional activity of Smad proteins in the promoter regions of some TGF-beta target genes (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). However, it is not clear whether Smad2 can also enhance the transcriptional activity of p53. In our study, since blockade of autocrine TGF-beta signaling with DNRII expression or RIKI treatment did not significantly change total p53 levels without or with mitomycin C treatment, the reduced p53 binding to its target gene promoters in DNRII-expressing cells was likely due to the inhibition of p53 activity or the blockade of p53 binding to its cis element on its target gene promoters by chromatin remodeling. Studies have shown that Smad proteins cannot activate the transcription of Smad-responsive promoters in the absence of histones or chromatin templates in an in vitro transcription system. Smad2-mediated transcription requires the acetylation of nucleosomal histone H3 and H4 by p300 acetyl-transferase (XREF_BIBR). The study also showed that TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activity required the interaction between phosphorylated Smad2 and the ATPase subunit Brg1 of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BAF and PBAF. Thus TGF-beta/Smad-regulated transcription involves chromatin remodeling. Because Smad-binding elements are between two p53 binding elements ~400-500 base pairs apart in the human p21 promoter (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), we speculate that blockade of TGF-beta signaling reduces Smad proteins at the p21 promoter, resulting in altered chromatin structure and reduced access to the cis binding element by p53.\n\nWhile this article was in preparation, an article appeared reporting that TGF-beta signaling is required for oncogenic Ras-induced senescence in a p53- and p21-independent manner in HMECs that are not immortalized by exogenous hTERT (XREF_BIBR). In that study, it was shown that although ectopic expression of an oncogenic Ras induced p21 expression and SLGA in HMECs, the growth arrest could not be rescued by stable knockdown of p53 or p53 together with p21, indicating that p21 and p53 are not required for Ras-induced senescence. We speculate that the discrepancy between that study and our study is likely due to the expression of hTERT in our HMECs resulting in different sensitivity to Ras-induced SLGA.\n\nIn untransformed and early neoplastic epithelial cells, TGF-beta can potently inhibit cell proliferation by maintaining the Rb protein in hypophosphorylated state via the stimulation of CDK inhibitors p15ink4b and p21 (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR) and the inhibition of Cdc2/Cdk1 (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR). TGF-beta has also been shown to inhibit the expression of c-Myc (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), which in turn can also regulate the expression of cell cycle-related proteins and induce Rb phosphorylation (XREF_BIBR). As such, the TGF-beta autocrine pathway is tumor suppressive, and various components in the pathway have been shown to be mutationally inactivated during carcinogenesis (XREF_BIBR). In our study, the DNRII- or RIKI-attenuated TGF-beta signaling resulted in the escape of Ras-induced SLGA in immortalized HMECs, providing evidence that TGF-beta suppresses tumorigenesis not only by simply inhibiting cell cycle, but also by mediating oncogene-induced senescence. Of interest, the attenuation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling by DNRII not only promoted tumorigenicity of oncogenic Ras-transfected HMECs, but also increased their metastatic potential. Although the higher number of spontaneous lung metastases induced by orthotically inoculated DNRII + Ras cell in comparison to those induced by the Ras clones may be due to the higher primary tumor burden in the DNRII + Ras cell-inoculated mice, our results in the tail vein injection experiment demonstrate that the attenuation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling enhanced Ras-induced metastatic potential of the hTERT-immortalized HMECs.\n\nIn summary, our results indicate that p21 appears to be a major player in mediating Ras-induce SLGA, as well as in the suppression of SLGA, when autocrine TGF-beta signaling is attenuated in hTERT-immortalized HMECs. As such, the novelty of our study is twofold. First, it identifies p21 as the major mediator of Ras-induced SLGA in a TGF-beta signaling-dependent manner in HMECs.
